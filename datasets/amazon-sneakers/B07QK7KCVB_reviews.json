I bought them for the white color so I can paint them and put lobsters \ud83e\udd9e on them. I couldn\u2019t find shoes with lobster prints made for the shoes so I decided to make my own. As advertised, with great seamless structured shoes as I hoped for. Though the only problems you might have is it\u2019s white and something that can get dirty or strain might make you consider keeping them a inside shoes or spray them down with water proof spray for outside use. Other then that they\u2019re snug on my feet and it\u2019s my first time styling my own shoes so I hope they look good."

They pair great with casual dresses and shorts. My only complaint is that when they are new, they take a little time to break in - very typical for any shoe like this. The inside lip on the back of the shoe rubbed a little against my heel with each step, so this caused some discomfort. But now they are fine. Once they wear out, I would buy them again."

However, there was one aspect that I saw come up repeatedly and I will have to agree; the insole.  If you wear with your bare feet, which I typically do, the inner insole will come out when you take your foot out of the shoe.  It can be a bit annoying, but not the end of my world.  The shoes look cute and are comfortable.  I really like the padding on the back heel area.  Great shoes for the price!"

These Amazon Essentials slip on sneakers are well made, thick canvas and thick soles. Many reviews complained that the insoles comes out when taking off the shoes, That doesn't happen with the pair that I received. I even tried taking the insoles out by hand, and they are securely glued down. They are pure white and the size fits very well. As with any new shoes, they will stretch and form to your feet after several wears. I bought some Kiwi sneaker whitener to clean them when they get dirty. I highly recommend these ship on sneakers!"

I only bought these to have a pair of slip-on shoes to wear while cleaning the house (a weekly 4-hour task). I normally wear 7 Wide but will size up to 7.5 if Wide is not an option, like with these. The width of the 7.5 is still quite snug, but the length is as expected. My biggest problem with these is that the height of the bridge of my foot is larger than the shoe opening wants to be, so the top of my foot ends up looking pretty beat up when I'm done cleaning.

    "message": "At this price, it seemed worth the risk of a bad fit.  Alas, too tight in width and depth despite sizing up as suggested.  When I remove the shoes, the sole follows.  So as a square footed (short/wide) person, I recommend paying more for safer/better fit.  For slimmer feet, these might serve."

Very uncomfortable and unable to be worn for more than half an hour. I own a gray pair and the material and fit are completely different. I tried a size up in the black but it didn't make a difference-still uncomfortable."

The details are perfect. Super simple, tasteful, none of that weird stitching or obvious give aways that scream \"I can't afford brand names!\" I love these shoes."

I wore them a little more and they ended up stretching out and getting comfortable except one of the feet seemed tighter than the other for a little while longer.. The inside bottom liner comes up and out sometimes when I take them off. For the price not horrible but would not purchase again"
