    "message": "Why do they stop makiing great shoes?  I've been buying kswiss for years because they were the absolute best.  Super comfort and support.  But they change them so that now they are only very good shoes.  I expect they will conform to my foot in time (stretch) because they feel tighter than they normally do.  They are still better than any other kind.  Unlike Sketchers, these KSwiss hug my foot for great support.  But similar to Sketchers, these KSwiss have areas that rub, like on my left big toe.  Heavier socks would help but these are too tight now for heavier socks than thin cotton summer weight.  I've all along bought size 7, so that's what i ordered.  That's what i got.  No problem, but these are not as comfortable as the size 7's i used to get.  They felt smooth inside all over, these don't.  The style is a little different, look more like Sketchers too.  I really prefer the old ones.  I still have 2 pair of them, they have conformed too well with my feet, plus i've worn them geocaching and hiking, so it was time for new ones.  But i couldn't find my kind in the stores.  I panicked and bought Sketchers but were quite unhappy with them.  So glad to have found KSwiss on Amazon even tho they are not super like the older ones, they are still very very good and i recommend them.  I tried every other kind on that were available in a well stocked sneaker store.  Believe me, KSwiss are still the best.  They've held up surprisingly well.  Plus i like the gripper soles for walking all sorts of trails, this is really an important feature which many sneakers do not have.  KSwiss are still the best."

This is a good shoe for casual wear but I've been wearing them for pickleball too.  The quick stops and starts, the quick change of direction, have not been kind to the inside back of the shoe.  For the price, this shoe does NOT stand up well to wear and tear though I know this is not a pickleball shoe.  I end up with a perfectly good outer shoe with holes worn in that area.

For me they are awesome! My only issues are what looks to be seam malfunctions. On the tongue instead of being flat against my foot, the seams are pressed against my foot on the edges of the seam and cause deep indents in my skin and have started to make my foot go numb. Also, there is a bubble that has formed on the inside of my right shoe by my big toe where the two parts come together and it is uncomfortable but something I can deal with. Along with the seam issue. It is better now but I sometimes still have to maneuver the seams around. But all in all very comfortable shoes to wear. Minor issues with how durable and comfortable they are. They also seem to be waterproof. I haven't walked into water with them but no water has ever touched my socks no matter how wet I get them! However, not slick resistant much! AND these are very very stiff when first recieved!! Very hard to break in and it hurts beware!!"

Everything was okay at first, but not perfect. Really good support for lateral movement and the cushioning makes it easy to stay light on your feet (sometimes it has the opposite effect and you sort of sink in). I'm ordering a second pair a half size down because they do stretch over time and I like them on the snug side. (I've been wearing my last pair for a year and in the summer I played tennis almost daily--a few times a week once we moved indoors--and these have lasted well). I will probably need to break them in around the house a bit before playing in them."

We've tried different colors too in this same shoe, so this type it what the black w/ purple trim, very pretty.  However after 2 days of practice the bottom sole is coming off.  In comparing w/ her the pair purchased before these, they have a different sole.  The manufacturer has changed the sole, so if you're looking for a court shoe, this isn't it.

They felt very supportive and sturdy. A lot of shoes feel hard with bad arch support but these were great and I am flat footed. I feel very comfortable being on my feet all day. No blisters or working the shoe in. I was shocked. I just expected  the annoying discomfort with new shoes. This is my first time using this brand but it won't be my last.

    "message": "Years ago I had a pair of K-Swiss shoes and loved them. I finally ordered another pair and I'm, falling in love with them again! I am on my feet for 8-9hrs while working and my feet have never been sore since getting these shoes. I think there is a little break in period with these but not from walking on them. Since they are leather, they are a more firm material. The top of my last two toes hurt a little but after about a week I feel no pain. I love that there was virtually no break in period and I can wear them for so long and so often without sore feet."

I'm the typical 7.5 m and these shoes need no breaking in for me. I do, however, add an insole to better support my flat feet. Would, have and will buy again."

I\u2019ve tried Nikes which for me it was too narrow not that I have wide feet. I\u2019ve tried sketchers still didn\u2019t work for me. K-Swiss is the only shoes that I can be on my feet for 10 hours without hurting and comfortable."
