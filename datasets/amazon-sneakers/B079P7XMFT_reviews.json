I wear at least 4 days a week for work. 2 months old now and they're still in like new condition. Great light weight sneaker that is great for walks, at the gym, at work, or just everyday sneaker. Easy to get on and off. Highly recommend!"

I did a two mile round trip walk to a playground in them immediately, and my feet were comfortable the whole time. Only downsides: I may get inserts for arch support, they aren\u2019t uncomfortable but not perfect either. And getting the shoes on was a slight hassle, the opening doesn\u2019t adjust so I had to really wiggle my foot in all the way, and that took an extra bit of time when I wanted to just put them on and get out of the door. They may stretch with time but that could backfire also."

    "message": "I purchased the \"Lace Up Jogger\" shoe in both the Olive and the Black with Pink trim, size 6.  I bought them confidently, fully expecting that they would be of the same quality and similar to the Nautica jogger/walking shoes I had twice purchased and loved in the past.  I had put miles and miles and stood for hours and hours on my feet in my Nautica shoes, almost always on cement, and my feet never felt tired.  I was very disappointed when these two new pair arrived.  I have a fairly wide foot, including bunions, and had no trouble wearing the old Nauticas.  I was surprised when I couldn't even get my foot in the black/pink shoes; they don't have the typical lace design that you can loosen all the way to the top of the shoe to fit your foot.  Instead of having a tongue, the part you insert your foot into (the mouth? :)) is a solid circle of elastic!  You are supposed to slip your foot into it like a tight sock, and the laces are apparently just for looks!  The shoe is very narrow.  So the black one immediately went back into the box and I moved on to the Olive pair. While the Olive pair does have a tongue and laces, the shoe material has very little give. The tongue sticks way up, and the lace holes are spread so far apart that my foot looks like it's bursting out of the shoe.  Like the black shoe, the Olive is too narrow for my foot.  (Note:  I wear a size 6, but I do not need to buy my shoes in Wide.) For anyone who had and loved Nauticas like the old ones I hoped to duplicate with this order, I am attaching a photo of my feet in both my old shoe (right) and the Olive shoe that just arrived.  You can see the ridiculously long, too narrow tongue on the Olive one.  A big difference in comfort styling between the old and new design is this: the old one has elastic \"eyelets\" for the laces to go through, which gives much more flexibility than the stiff holes in the plastic through which the laces pass on the Olive shoe.  I personally need the flexibility that the elastic eyelets offer. As for visual styling, I think the Olive shoe looks like an old lady's shoe, while I had many compliments from young and old on my old Nauticas.  No one of any age should walk on a slick surface in these new Nauticas, however; as other reviewers commented (and I ignored, due to my past experience with Nautica): The bottom of these shoes is a slick plastic.  I wore them for an hour in my home to see if I could grow to like them, and found myself slipping on my wood floor. I thought Nautica was supposed to be a decent brand, but these shoes seem no better than cheap shoes I always pass up at places like Payless Shoes.  I am returning both, and will go to a local shoe store to try on shoes to try to find something like my old, comfy Nauticas.  These certainly don't qualify."

I like that the tongue is attached to the rest of the shoe so you can slip these on pretty quickly without it bunching up. These felt pretty good when I was running, I definitely noticed some cushioning as opposed to my old pair of shoes. They do feel kind of slippery when on smooth surfaces, so be very careful if you're wearing on tile or hardwood. My gym has a more textured floor so I didn't slip, but I feel like that's a legitimate possibility in these. Maybe they get better as you wear them, I'm not sure. I noticed these were a bit roomy, so if you have wide feet you'll like these. I got my usual size 8.5 and they fit just fine, but again, they definitely have a little extra room at the sides of your feet. My only gripe is that they're very smooth inside which kind of made my foot shift around easier as I ran."

I like the style and look, but can not handle the pain.  I read someones elses review and they ordered Dr. Scholls foot inserts.  I am hoping that will make a difference.  I had a pink pair on order and just cancelled them.  :o("
