As usual before ordering i look up the brands official size chart (toe to heel measurement) oh boy not only they do not know their own sizes but they surely don't know how to measure ! ordered a 11.5 or 45 euro size which translated according to their chart to my toe-to-heel i received an 11.5 or 45 but measured up it sized equal to a 13 or 47 euro size according most other brands... Also there is zero comfort or quality in this shoe, there is no padding on the sides and bottom, the inner sole is just flat and thin, painfully to walk with even if its the proper size. the shoes feel cheap."

I have used these for going to the amusement park with my children and after a full day of chasing, riding and walking my feet survived, but would have been happier in my Nike runners.  They look great with jeans, khakis, or shorts and with just a little care last two years before cracking and falling apart.  I am using this same review for another pair as they are equal with the exception of color and minor cosmetics.  I have been wearing different iterations of these for going on 4 years and the quality and fit has been consistent."
