I LOVE ROCKET DOG, to this day they are the only fashion brand that actually cares about your comfort in every step.  Easy to wear and super easy to wash and keep clean so they always look fresh.  Highly recommend anyone to buy these sneakers if they care about the comfort of their feet while still looking good!"

I think if I went up a half size they would be too big. I have narrow to normal feet and I did not feel like these run narrow like others have said. They are actually really comfy on the bottom. They are nice and squishy! I honestly really like them and am surprised many didn\u2019t. The only problem I had was that they sent me the wrong color."

I'm glad I didn't listen. I'm in the healthcare field, on my feet all day. I wore these to work and normally take my shoes off when I come home. I've been home for 20 mins and I still haven't taken them off. I will say that I do have narrow feet but average narrow. They fit very well and extremely comfortable for me. I will also say that there is no arch support but I have strong arches, so that didn't matter to me, my get feel great If I could give them 100 stars I would. Give them a chance, you'll love them. Also I'm usually a size 9, but purchased a 9 and a half because of the review. They are slightly too big."

If this is a prime wardrobe selection that most likely has a 50/50 chance of being returned not sure why you would not put it in a bag big enough for me to use the return option on the packaging that you guys have. You stuffed this shoebox into a small bag. This is being placed here because there is no way to tell you otherwise and I'm not calling Amazon for this."

These are 6 eyelet, low top, basketball-style, shoes. They feature thick, rubber, soles with a protective, rubber, toe cap. There is a padded heel collar. The insole is made of memory foam, I think, and it's super comfortable under your foot. The laces are wider than usual and give the impression of ribbons, which gives the shoe a more feminine look. They are completely black - even the soles. The sizing is accurate and they are just wonderful. I like them better than Converse Chuck Taylor's in all black because they are much more comfortable."

There are 6 metal eyelets used, the collar is padded and there is light padding in the tongue. The memory foam innersole is soft and comfortable and while there is moderate arch support depending upon the user\u2019s needed it may need to be augmented. The rubber sole is lightly textured which should provide some help maintaining footing on wet and slippery surfaces. I wear a size 8 1/2 shoe and with a pair of light/medium socks the fit in the same size shoe is perfect so they are true-to-size. Excellent."
