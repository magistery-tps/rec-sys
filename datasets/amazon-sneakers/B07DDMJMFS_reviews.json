    "message": "I don't understand some of these negative reviews. I've been shopping with Amazon for several years now, and whenever I've had an issue with ANY product, Amazon Customer Service has bent over backward to make me happy, even when the mistake was due to my own stupidity or ignorance. If you're not happy with a purchase you've made here, at least call their toll-free Customer Service number and let them try to help you to sort things out. Okay. Now that I've gotten that off my chest, on with my own review: After some extensive shopping both locally and online, I ordered a pair of these Reeboks from Amazon because, for some stupid reason, shoe stores no longer carry Reebok shoes (one manager even told me that Reebok went out of business)! I live in northern Indiana, so I shopped several (many) stores in Columbia City, Warsaw, Fort Wayne, LaGrange, Angola and Marion over a period of about four months. To be fair, a few stores had one or two pair of Reeboks, but none had the style I was looking for, nor did they have them in my size. Because I needed a pair of white sneakers, I finally relented and bought a pair of Nikes from Shoe Show in Columbia City. I wear a 14 (4E), and they had plenty of different styles of Nikes in that size, but no Reeboks. Anyway, while the Nikes were not bad shoes, they just weren't comfortable, even after I had worn them for a couple of weeks, so I decided to buy the shoes I wanted in the first place, which brought me back to Amazon.com. I've been wearing Reebok Classics for fifteen years, but they weren't available here in my size, so I thought I'd try the very similar Club Memt. I placed my order after midnight on May 9th. I'm not an Amazon Prime member, so I was satisfied when my order confirmation stated that my shoes would be delivered by May 16th. After all, shipping was free for these shoes, so I figured a week was reasonable for UPS Ground. I was delighted when I received an email the following morning saying my package had shipped and would be delivered by May 12th. I was absolutely flabbergasted when my order was dropped off at 1pm on May 11th! Less than 48 hours after I had placed my online order, my new shoes, in the correct size, were delivered to my doorstep in perfect condition. Are the soles thin? Well, yes, I suppose they are compared to basketball or hiking shoes, but these are casual-wear shoes, and they're not made for athletic activities or for slogging around in mud and gravel. I put a pair of good-quality gel insoles in them, along with a pair of heel/arch supports and, not only do they fit perfectly, they look great with my kakhi slacks or just a pair of blue jeans. More importantly, THEY'RE COMFORTABLE, and I enjoy wearing them. Now, honestly, they are white shoes, so they do get a little dirty when I wear them outside, but I've discovered an ingenious solution to this problem: I WIPE THEM OFF WITH A DAMP RAG WHEN I GET HOME. I guess I should mention that I paid full price for these shoes, and I was offered no incentive to leave a positive review. I retired from the U.S. Navy in 1995 and I do not work for Amazon.com, Reebok nor for any other company. I wrote this review because I like and wear Reebok shoes, and because I'm impressed with Amazon.com's customer-oriented business model and their unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction. If you've taken the time to read my loquacious comments, I hope they've been helpful to you in making an informed shopping decision."

Not too harshly but enough to ruin self admiration (I don\u2019t think anyone else would notice). I\u2019m sure as the shoe breaks in further it will go away but by then the new shoe appeal is gone which is the point of white shoes (this is why this is my first pair of white shoes in over a decade).

So I've been wanting to try other brands but never wanted to take the time to experiment and I wasn't sure how many other brands had the wide size.  I bought a pair of these Reeboks in April for $44, didn't start wearing them until June and now it's time for new ones. When I went to go for the \"old faithful\", I was shocked to see a gigantic price increase up to $60! WTH? This lead me to do what I've never done- search amazon by \"shoes extra wide 8.5\"  and I found out there are 100s of shoes in the extra wide size! I bought some Skechers that look very similar for $38- we will see how they fit and last. But anyway, I just wanted to thank Reebok for that huge increase that finally motivated me to realize there are many choices with extra wide (this was always very hard to find in brick and mortar stores, not so on Amazon). a 25% price increase is a GREAT way to get rid of those lifelong customers that were only marginally enthusiastic about your shoes, but were buying them out of habit.

They do run narrow, but I read the reviews and ordered a size wider than I normally wear, and right out of the box they fit better than pretty much any other shoe I've worn. Despite constant use and impacts, the seams are still going strong, there's very little wear on the soles, and with occasional oiling the leather is still strong and pliable. The biggest advantages to me, as someone who walks a lot on mixed terrain, are the combination of light weight, durability, and a surprisingly grippy and flexible sole. I would highly recommend these to anyone who works on their feet a lot. The one downside is that the soles are not terribly supportive, but that's actually a plus to me because I'm used to being barefoot or wearing thin leather soles outside of work, so it feels more natural and doesn't leave my feet sore."

They're comfortable enough to wear anywhere whether at work or home, walking, hiking, etc. They typically last a while too. I've already gotten dye on them, but that just adds character. Life is about the journey, not the destination."

I saw the style online in Reebok classics I love the gum soul with the heel brown highlight. However as you can see in the video the white portion that meets the gum rubber is someone painted on and peeling off after only two weeks. I realize he\u2019s a white shoes and they\u2019re gonna get dirty. However a small amount of dirt and scuffs can be cleaned I can\u2019t fix peeling rubber. I just wishes are better because I really like the look of them. Very low quality I wouldn\u2019t buy again. I hope these photos and review are helpful."
