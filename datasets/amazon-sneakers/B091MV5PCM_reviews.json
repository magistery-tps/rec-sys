Different colors fit differently it seems. Overall, really nice looking and clean."

The heels keep falling off when I am on the shoes, no matter how tight I tie the laces. Since I trust the quality of the brand (as I've tried the shoes), I went to buy another shoes from Rebok, suspecting that heel problem was a specific issue with the design of this model. Unfortunately, I found that the second pair of shoes from Rebok also had the same issue. Now I am starting to think that all Rebok shoes would give me such experience. I don't have such issues normally. I think the shape of my feet is typical, not having specific demands for shoes.  I don't know how the shoes fit others. It seems that the reviewers have not mentioned this point. But anyway, the shoes are in good quality and worth the money. Maybe the shoes would fit you."

They are super cute and on trend with the white vintage sneaker trend. They look cute with both wide leg and skinny jeans. They are super comfortable too! I ordered the same size 8 I normally wear in Nike and they fit great. I like these better than the club C Reebok sneakers. The club C weren\u2019t as comfortable and were more narrow. My daughter also picked these over Nike Air Force 1s because she said these are more comfortable. All her friends like them too. :)"
