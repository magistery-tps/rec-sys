    "message": "These shoes actually look pretty nice.  I thought they might look really cheap but they are not bad.  The problem is, the sock part on the ankles is too big and mine did not come with real laces.  The lace up area does not go up high enough and the heel area is too big.  Therefore, my feet tend to come up out of the back when walking.  I just received these and tried walking around the house in them.  I really need something for my feet as my feet hurt all the time due to some health issues.  Wearing a good comfortable sneaker helps and I needed a new pair a.s.a.p.  I am debating on whether to send these back or not.  I need something now and I hate sending things back from Amazon because I always seem to get screwed out of part of my money somehow.  The inside of these shoes are comfortable, I will give it that.  I just think the ankle area should be smaller with better stretch for those who have large ankles and I am not sure if it's just me but the heel area is way too big for a normal (not wide) size sneaker.  I am older and have to worry about falling and tripping.  So I am going to buy some shoe inserts and try that but if it doesn't help with keeping the shoe on my foot, I will sadly have to return these."

Just so you know I am not a picky person. I just bought a dress that I wasn't happy with from Amazon, but luckily I know how to sew so I made the necessary adjustments.

I wear size 8 in a close-toed shoe and ordered size 8 1/2, so I'll just wear a thicker sock. I'm sure I'll want a roomier shoe for days when my feet are sore or swollen. No blisters or discomfort wearing them on the first day. I was so pleased to feel air coming into the shoe around my toes. I stand and walk for 13 hrs. a day at work (two jobs, different shoes for each), plus I stand more while at home without shoes--so I do a lot of standing. They are easy to slip on over a sock, no straining, and quick! The top is soft around your toes and arch, so if you need no pressure at the toes, like me, these are for you. I like that there are no shoelaces to trip over if they become untied. My only complaint is that the heel is higher than the toes so that may bother my back after a few days but I plan to alternate with other shoes. If you need protection from falling objects, this shoe isn't for you. I have a high arch and do not need support, so I'm not sure about that area, yet."

    "message": "I wasn't expecting to actually like theese sneakers. I am a \"plus size\" women and I walk heavy on my heels so all my shoes wear out fast especially on the heels. So when I saw these I specifically was buying them for work so it would be easy in my feet with all the walking I do. Surprisingly they are super heel supporting. The heel is like a shock absorbing heel that feels like I am walking on a zero impact cloud. However I will say if you are wide foot person. You will hate the shoes. They are very narrow. I had to stretch the material to not feel like my circulation in my was dying. But now that I have done that they are great. Also, I have arch issue in my feet so I added my own sole insert on top of the shoe provided insert for my extra support and I am walking awesome! I will buy another pair."
