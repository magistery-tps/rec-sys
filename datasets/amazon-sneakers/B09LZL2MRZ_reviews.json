With narrow feet, normally I\u2019m tightening the straps to death just to have some stability, and with these, I didn\u2019t have to do that. They\u2019re very comfy, I get through an eight hour shift in healthcare with these without having absurdly sore feet. When these inevitably break down, because I wear them literally every day, I\u2019ll be getting another pair. I\u2019ve had them for over six months now though, and they still look darn near new, so that might be a while. Here\u2019s to hoping they don\u2019t discontinue them."

    "message": "I have no real complaints with these.  Would I buy them again from here, probably not considering the other terrible reviews, but I'm definitely satisfied for the price I paid. Normally I would have picked a shoe in black or gray, but there was a sale going on, and so I paid $35 for the pink pair.  To be honest, I can't tell if these are fake or not.  Everything appears to be symmetrical on both sneakers, the stitching looks good, laces are the same size, all shoe lace holes are the same size, they both fit the same, etc.  I will admit, I'm not a sneaker connoisseur so they might very well be knockoffs,  but for $35.00 I really don't care.  Had I paid double that, it might be more of an issue, so my best advice would be to wait for your size to be on sale, or buy another color that is. They look cute, they're hella comfortable and I can run in them in ease. I'm normally a 7.5 but I ordered these in an 8 just in case, and they fit comfortably with or without socks."

There\u2019s not a ton of padding inside and the sole of the shoe doesn\u2019t really feel like a sturdy rubber, almost sort of more like a foam plastic. Like, they almost feel like fake Adidas. It\u2019s hard to explain. They do feel very cheap, but surprisingly I really like them because they fit so well and seem to be pretty comfortable. I\u2019ll probably put some inserts inside.
