The tongue of the shoe buldged out from behind the laces, making your foot look fat from the side view. If you have slightly wider feet, you are going to need to go up in either a half size or full size so your toes don't rub on the sides. The shoe itself made my feet look look small and large at the same time because of the slender design which made it look smaller on the sides and long in the toe box. The shape of the actual sneaker wasn't really attractive when put on. Don't really know how to describe the shape, other than a triangle from the side view. I returned and didn't repurchase a bigger size just because of the shape. Maybe it just wasn't my style. The shoe was comfortable, though."

Just like my other ones I got from the store many moons ago. Wear them with a dress or with some athletic wear or some cute jeans! We recently went to Texas Wine Country where we did a lot of walking and these shoes were perfect for a pregnant mama like me. They are comfortable and lightweight. They also do not seem to stain easily, having kids you get lots of things spilled on you, but I haven\u2019t noticed any major stains - just your usual wear from walking around."

They look great to other people and I guess that is all that matters right? I live in a place where it gets over 110 degrees each day, therefore, feet naturally sweat. These babies dont air out, at all. I dont wear these shoes if I am going to be outside doing stuff, they start squeaking from the sweat. Comfort is great though."

I wore what you would now call Classic / Vintage Reebok\u2019s sneakers in High School \u2014 and a few years beyond. But, to kick around in when I wasn\u2019t in school, my go to shoes were my Van\u2019s. One day recently, I received a seriously discounted coupon for Reebok Stores. I took a look online and found these Reebok Club C85 Sneakers. I purchased a pair of the Club C Coast sneakers from the Reebok online store, and a few months later, I purchased another pair on Amazon. I now had two pairs of Reebok Club C Coast Sneakers and a pair of Old Skool Van\u2019s, but I still purchased another pair of Reeboks \u2014 Club C85 sneakers because I liked them so much. I use my Van\u2019s inside to workout, and my Reebok\u2019s for going out. These Reebok Club C85\u2019s are just as comfortable as my Vans. In fact, they are extremely comfortable, feel great to walk in and look great while doing so. As others have mentioned, these shoes run a bit narrow. I have high arches and narrow feet, so they are just the right fit for me."

The first pair that came in were snug, but I figured they needed to be broken in. That fact along with the fact it's a unisex size and not necessarily made for a woman's foot, I gave some leeway for the feel. The second pair that arrived was noticeably larger. Same exact size, model, etc... but I could tell from the numbering on the tongue they weren't from the same production line. Not sure if it was a different plant or just a different timeframe. Other than that, they're great. Love the style, love the material. Did have to buy inserts to allow for more of an arch, which made the snug pair even snugger... :( but....I love the old school crest logo for Reebok."

I saw where someone mentioned these not being as comfortable as the ones from Urban, I can somewhat agree in that they do feel a bit different but I\u2019ve only had a few days to break them in so hopefully they last!"

    "message": "As mentioned by other reviewers, the shoes are in great quality. Being made of leather and benefiting from great workmanship, the shoes are durable and comfortable. They might be tight for someone who has a little bit wide feet. The only issue I am having with the shoes is the heel. My heels keep falling off, though the size and the overall configuration of the shoes are great fit for me. I have to return the shoes because I cannot stand with the falling off. It is worth to mention that this is the second Rebok shoes I've bought from Amazon, but the previous ones also have the similar issue with the heel. I have to return both of them, suspecting that Rebook shoes would not fit me."
