I am a 7M and fit just right.  I look the sole being kind of thick as I am rather short (5.1) and feel super short without shoes lifting me up a bit. \ud83d\ude09 The only thing I am not super crazy about is the tongue of the shoe has an unfinished look\u2026but I can live with it. Totally recommend them and will update once I have had a chance to wear them! \ud83d\ude0a"

But they are also sporty and still work with skirts/dresses or slacks/jeans. I always receive compliments on them when I wear them out. They were also comfortable right out of the box. I plan to order another pair in different colors. Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for the vintage kicks that are cushy too."

The fit was definitely tighter than expected so I would recommend sizing up. Other than that they were cute shoes but cheaply made in my opinion. Around the laces of the shoes there was exposed foam material and it made it look unfinished and cheap. These shoes aren\u2019t for me and I would\u2019ve expected them to be a lower price for the quality received. They\u2019re also not comfortable to wear for a long period of time."
