They are very eye catching and add a pop of excitement to your outfits but for me\u2026 they were very narrow. I couldn\u2019t get my foot in the shoe. I usually wear a 7.5 but I couldn\u2019t wear these due to the width. I do have chubby feet but I don\u2019t usually wear a wide size in sneakers. I guess these were not for me but they are very cute."

Besides catching the ladies' attention, surprisingly a lot of men like them too...I am married but there have been a lot of rando men loving and complimenting on my shoes as well. I mean these shoes essentially does the flirting for you...they are also good icebreakers cause when you walk into a room, people will not only compliment them but also ask what brand they are; where you bought them, etc...all in all, I LOVE them; these shoes are dramatic and glorious! I normally wear a size 5.5 or 6 and got a 6 for these shoes...I suggest sticking with your usual size and do not size down. The shoes actually look a little bulkier than what I usually wear/prefer, but I think it's because of all the padding, which makes the shoes sooo comfortable! I am petite, so I LOVE that these shoes give me some additional height! Yes, these shoes look fabulous but they are also practical as well...they are comfortable and solid shoes to wear for a while. I enjoy going on really long walks and these shoes worked out perfectly! As dramatic/loud these shoes look, they actually go with a lot of outfits...these shoes are definitely the stand out piece, so just make sure you don't have a lot of eye catching prints on and let the shoes show off itself. All in all, these shoes are trendsetting! They can compliment your fun, creative, funky and outgoing personality! They are like almost perfect!!"

If you like funky looking shoes, these are perfect for you. They position your foot a little forward and they run small. I usually wear a size 8 but ordered these in an 8 1/2. They are narrow in the front of the foot and around the toe but a little wider in the heel. Order a half size larger than what you normally wear and just wear a thicker sock. I love these! I did not buy them to wear them as sneakers but as funky looking shoes. The only reason I gave it four stars is that I think this one was purchased and returned. There was no packing in the shoe insole look like somebody was wearing it a little bit. I was not about to return it because they are so hard to find."
