The rubber sole separated within just a couple of weeks and had to be glued back on. Once I replaced the insole with workman's inserts from Home Depot and took some Shoe Goo to the outer soles, they became some of the best shoes I've ever owned. Used some spray-on waterproofing and they're even good in the winter. Great grip even on ice and snow! If you don't mind some extra care, these can become some amazing work shoes.  Highly recommend... If you have some good glue and inserts for them!"

Over the last few years, my foot width has changed from D width to a little wider.  I thought I would try a wider width sneaker, and am delighted that this Skechers 12-W fits my reshaped foot perfectly.  They were comfortable from the first time I put them on.  I\u2019ve been wearing them daily, and am verily pleased  with fit, comfort, and style."

    "user": "Amazon Customer",

    "message": "I wanted to leave a review for these shoes specifically because Amazon has a habit of throwing old reviews at the buyer rather than more recent ones. There aren't many with a fair critique, or they resort to \"omg it sucks/rocks\". So, here we go. After years of using TredSafe shoes due to just not having the money to afford fancy-shmancy, I bit the bullet on these shoes figuring I could at least default to other shoes if they didn't work out. Also, a lot of reviews complained on durability and such, but they were recommended, so I went for it. Durability: Uhhhh, folks must have run over their pairs with a lawn mower to get them wrecked like they were, because wow have mine been accidentally kicked into and scraped by a LOT of old metal equipment and hardware with basically no damage. Really, the only damage was a screw I somehow stepped on, drilling a hole into the bottom. I mean, it didn't poke my foot, so no harm done. Comfort: Okay, so memory foam is a big \"your mileage may vary\" situation, but generally the foam is pretty okay in these shoes. Seeing as I run around a lot more at my new job than I did my old one, these do pretty good at cushioning my 13W feet. Then again, I am also a tall dude, so the memory foam cushioning may not be as effective for me. It hasn't been long enough to really wear it out either, but again, your mileage may vary. Also depends on whether you really understand memory foam, which I kind of don't. I might be totally off-base. But anyways. Even without that, the general feel and support of the shoe is good. The fact that my heels basically never hurt after eight-hour shifts when they would tend to hurt in the old, cheap TredSafe shoes is a pretty good testament to that fact. The fit: It fits...? I mean, 13W feet, I bought 13W. It fit pretty much as expected. The only minor complaint I can make is more a special case: there isn't a lot of room for inserts. See, I'm weird and have a tendency to put more pressure on the front of my feet than the heel, and not a shoe can be found at reasonable price for someone weird like me. I'd like to be able to fit some front support into the shoes to counter that, but there's just not enough room. Maybe once I wear out the memory foam, but otherwise... Well, that's a \"me\" thing. If you walk like a normal person rather than like I did as a kid to catch late-night TV without being caught, then you should be okay. Other stuff: One other minor complaint is just a typical sneaker issue but a bit worse. When the bottoms of the shoes get wet, walking on any kind of hard floor gives off an obnoxious squeaking sound. I don't mean like \"basketball court\" squeaking. I mean like \"twisting leather\" squeaking. To be fair... They're sneakers. They'll make noise like that, but it's usually not that annoying. They do dry out pretty quick so long as you don't keep getting them wet, so it doesn't last particularly long. So... Four stars? Yeah. They're pretty good overall, and they sure do take a beating. I keep expecting something I do to rip it open, but there isn't a single tear or crack anywhere (besides the hole from the screw). Main problem is just memory foam getting in the way of using inserts, lack of front foot support for those like yours truly, and the obnoxious wet squeak. Still a solid shoe, though. Worth the money."

    "message": "First time I'd ever tried a pair of these \"memory foam\" footbed type shoes.  Since I suffer from some nasty neuropathy in the foot I thought maybe these would allow me to walk more, and more often with my dog. At first the foam was breaking-in and was causing me significant foot pain, and then about the second week everything changed and I could actually walk again without too much pain.  The foam had broken-in to my foot and it was almost like walking on a pillow.  For about 3 to 4 months that is.  Running my hand inside the shoe I could feel the depression of my foot in this foam, and the foam was now so thin that this pillow experience was no longer there.  I wore these for an additional four months as there was still \"some\" cushioning left, but nothing like the beginning.  And since I'm on a fixed income I cannot afford to buy new shoes every four months or so.  So after a year I've bought a second pair.  If the foam in these breaks down after about the same amount of time I guess I'll start looking for something else, but at least I will get some relief from the foot pain.  I suppose if you don't wear these every day like I did then they may last you longer than they did for me.  You should know."

They're stylish and fit well. If there is any negative to Skechers, it is that they don't last as long as some other name brands, but that's any easy tradeoff for the comfort they provide."

    "message": "At least on wide sizes, the memory foam cushion doesn't cover the entire area where your foot rests.  There is about a one-quarter inch gap between the foam and the edge of the sole, meaning the outside edge of your foot (where you place a lot of your weight) and the  tips of your smaller toes fall into this gap.  The result is quite uncomfortable.  Markedly worse than a shoe with no cushion at all. I do not know if this issue is present un the standard widths as well.  I do know that unless this design flaw is corrected, this will be my last pair."
