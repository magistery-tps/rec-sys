Just think about how many times do you actually lace your shoes out of millions times you put them on and take them off throughout the day, probably almost never, so whats the point? These ones look very stylish, very soft and comfortable, don't have an over-engineered outsole, therefore, easy to clean. Best thing about them is you can literally put them on without bending over and even touching the shoe with your hands, while at the same time still they are able to stay on firmly."

I returned and ordered a 12 and seems to be just as tight as the 11s were. The 12s which I still have seem to be loosening up a bit but are still alittle tight. Comfy but not sure if the sizing changed or my feet did (every other shoe I own is an 11)"

    "message": "Great shoe overall. Feels comfortable to me after a few weeks use, no complaints. Comfort is subjective, so I can't add that to the pros list though. Pros: the fake laces give it a nice look like a lace up shoe. I hate how most slip-ons look like aqua socks, but the faux laces make it look more natural. Cons: none Note for size: After experimenting with a few orders, i ordered 2 sizes up. The reason is: these slip ons have a tight opening around the foot and it's not very elastic. So my normal shoe size fit well, but it was a bit difficult and tight to put on, which kind of defeats the purpose of a slip on which is supposed to be easy. Therefore I ordered two sizes up, from a 10.5 to 11.5. The shoe is about 1/2 inch too big in length but the width feels fine. as for the opening, it makes it much easier to slide into. As for the larger size, it's fine for gym workouts, but honestly..... slip ons aren't really meant to be used for actual heavy duty running workouts, so I dont' care that they're not a perfect fit in length. For me it's a great quick slip on shoe that is great for workouts and casual walking out and about."

Overall they are ideal for walking due to their lightweight and breathable nature (very similar to the Nike Free). To achieve the lightness however there were some sacrifices that had to be made.  First is the lack of ANY support for your foot/ankle.  These shoes will twist and bend without much pressure being applied.  Like I said - this is OK for walking, but I'd be cautious of doing anything that requires secure footing (CrossFit, running, lifting, etc). Secondly, there is NO arch support on this shoe.  The sole is completely flat, which presents its own set of issues...but be warned if you have a high arch...these shoes might hurt to wear."

I'm a size 8.5 in women sizes, so I'm a size 7 in men sizes. These shoes appealed to me because of their olive hue and the fact that they were produced from recyclable materials. They are comfortable without being overly tight (if you have a wider foot then the fit may be tight).There were some concerns with the quality of the product. The seams were not well sewn (view picture). In addition, there were a couple of deep scratches evident. However, it was not a huge concern for me. The loose threads were gently removed with scissors. The sneakers were made in Myanmar, according to a tag located on the inside. The bottom of the shoes were not slick, and the comfort level was adequate. It was also an advantage that the pricing was so low. As of today, still happy with this purchase."
