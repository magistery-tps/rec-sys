It gave the shoes a totally different look than I was expecting. If you\u2019re OK with a dressy tennis shoe, you\u2019ll probably love them but I wanted more of a true retro look."

    "message": "I love these but confusing about fit. I looked at reviews on this style everywhere with most people saying they run small or too narrow.  I\u2019ve been a 7 for years, but lately 7.5 seems to fit better, probably because I have wide feet.  I ordered these in size 7.5. Not only were they too long, they were a loose width wise as well. I have to return them. Ordering in a 7. I hope they fit!  Also, the cream color on top is satin. That could be a deterrent for some. I wasn\u2019t expecting it, but I still like them. Overall, I\u2019m mostly drawn to the color as they will go with a lot of different outfits."

When I ordered this pair I could only get an 11 which I knew would be fine.  The size 11 shoes wouldn\u2019t even go in my foot!! Luckily my 18 year old daughter lined the shoes and they actually fit her.  She normally wears a 9.  So I was disappointed with the sizing of this shoe that\u2019s why I gave only one star!!"
