I wear an 8 medium, and thankfully they will work for me.  I put them up to my other NB pairs, same size, and these are a good 1/2\" shorter.  They look great and have nice arch support, but don't have enough cushion at the balls of my feet.  I had to buy inserts at a shoe store to provide more padding."

The NB 410 trail shoe fits the same in every respect as the Hierro - I believe they are made on the same or nearly the same last. The main difference between the 410 and Hierro is the absence of the heel stabilizer extension. Since I walk rough chip-and-tar streets in my neighborhood, rather than trails, I do not miss the stabilizer. These shoes are more budget friendly so I hope to make these my go-to when I need replacements. One weird thing about these shoes was the original shoelaces - they have ridges (sort of corduroy-like) that made it hard to pull the laces tight - the friction of the ridges didn't allow the laces to slide in the holes.  I simply replaced the laces with an old pair and the shoes are easy to get on and off now."

I would suggest buying a wide if you are putting on big miles as your feet will swell and they will just be more comfortable at the end of the day.  Will buy again but will replace the laces."

This pair is comfortable and provides great stability but has two main problems. When I put them on, the heels (backs) of the shoes want to fold in as if they were slides and are very difficult to pull back up.  I finally used tweezers to pull them up  and they are better now that I've worn them several times but I have to be very careful putting them on, holding the loop until my foot is well seated. Also, the shoelaces are too short so I tried not putting them through the last set of holes but had to replace them because the shoes slipped without that final lacing. Unfortunately, it is impossible to find garnet laces so I had to use black. I know, not a performance issue but I really liked the garnet."

Very comfortable cushioning on the feet, great color scheme and good grip on the soles. Notes: Some of the color choices have ripstop uppers and some have mesh. You can kind of tell if you zoom in on the pictures and look at the fabric across the toes. Ripstop seems to be listed specifically in the descriptions for those shoes with it. I got a pair of Steel/Light Mango that has ripstop and a pair of Ocean Grey/Outerspace/Vivid Coral that are mesh. Also, I took other reviewer\u2019s advice and ordered a slightly larger size than normal and my normal size. Glad I did because the 9.5 was just a little too small, even though that\u2019s my usual size. The size 10 works best for me on these shoes. Overall, really happy with the shoes!"

Big toe had no additional room. I could have returned shoes and purchased a half-size larger, but I decided to try comparable brands instead. Too bad. I liked the appearance of all three shoes."
