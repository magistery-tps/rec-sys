So when I saw these on Amazon, I just ordered my usual sneaker size and hoped for the best. Well, they not look great & fit perfectly, they are SO comfortable right out of the box. They arrived quickly and were boxed up very nicely in a PUMA shoebox. I'm extremely satisfied! \ud83d\ude42"

They fit snug enough that my foot don't wiggle around in the shoe (I have a long narrow foot), but my toes still have plenty of room so they don't feel cramped up. I am a 7.5 normally and I ordered the 7.5 so they are true to size in my case. The shoe laces stay tied and never come undone on their own and the soles are very rubbery and slip resistant. I have wore them for about 2 weeks and they are made well and are durable as far as I can tell so far. I am happy with my purchase!"

So since my toe was crammed to the front, I ordered this 10.5, which I now know Puma runs small, you have to size up. Problem is, once Puma leaves 10, the shoe bevies a wide and the form/structure isn\u2019t the same. Now my foot is swimming in the shoe. Assuming this is a \u201crunning\u201d shoe, it\u2019s higher in the back and lower in the front so it always feels like my foot is always sliding down to the front out of my shoe. I\u2019m always adjusting. Other than that, they are very padded so very comfortable for walking, running, standing."

They have a very thick foam cushion insole that feels so good on my feet even after a 12 hour shift and then walking around the grocery store after work. No tired or achy feet at all. The laces are a little long for my liking, but I just tuck them in the side of the shoe and it worked well for me. The toe in these shoes runs very wide and I have fairly wide feet that typically hang off the sides of most women\u2019s sandals. I normally wear between a 7, 7.5, or 8 in most all shoes. A 7-7.5 in tennis shoes and 7.5-8 in dress shoes usually fit perfectly. If you have narrow feet, these are prob not gonna be a good fit. Even on my wide feet I have to pull the laces very tight and it scrunches up and wrinkles the whole side of the shoe where the laces are anchored. I still give this shoe 5 stars because they are very good construction and feel very well made, they are just a little too wide for my liking, but I\u2019m keeping them to wear in cooler weather (It\u2019s Florida so not that cold down here) as they will be much more comfortable with 2 pair or thicker socks. :)"

After a few hours working someone complemented my Puma\u2019s and that\u2019s when I realized how comfortable they were, I had forgotten I had a new pair of shoes on and they felt cushiony and supportive. I am a nurse who works 12 hour shifts and was impressed with these sneakers!!!"
