They are gorgeous and super sparkly. But I couldn\u2019t get past the fact that I finally splurged on something other than Walmart sneakers for my birthday and they came dirty. Update: it didn\u2019t give me the option to exchange for the same thing, so I returned and rebought.  The next pair came brand new, in plastic bags and clean and I am very happy with them.  The sparkle is incredible."

However I did not completely full size up-I am a 9, got 9.5. (As I didn't want to risk it with a 10.) So right out of the box I was like oh my goodness in all things fairy tale sparkle these shoes... Wow breathtaking. Didn't even have to put flash on these things to see they sparkle like mad! Beautiful crystals! Yet obviously on closer inspection there were pieces of lint embedded into the crystals, some threads popping out, and some glue lines and only one line of crystals missing on both shoes. Which isn't even all that bad? I got some tweezers and those minor flaws were fixed. Now for the sizing~ on immediate try on I was scared because after loosening all the laces my foot slid in easy and kind of felt, too big. I was like no! But after putting on socks and tightening them up it fits like a charm! I totally recommend getting your 1/2 size that way youll have enough space,-especially with thicker socks for this weather. The only disappointment I got from these is that everyone says they got an extra baggie for missing crystal repair and I didn't get one? I'm thinking I might have gotten a pair someone sent back. I really wanted some back up crystals to fix the missing ones. :/ However overall BUY THESE SHOES! if you live for sparkle go for it girl! Catch me at Disney on Christmas wearing them lol"

It's too late for me to return because these are for my flower girl and the wedding is in just 9 days. They are really cute and iv purchased the other style with the gemstones and I had absolutely no problems with those."

I was disappointed because without really looking the shoe is super cute and sparkly but the craftsmanship is awful!"

I held the 8.5 and the 9 up side by side and they were both the same length. Sizing is inconsistent. I will be returning both sizes and trying an 8. The shoe is so cute so hopefully this works.."

You will definitely catch a lot of attention in these beauties! Now, as for the size they run narrow and small. Luckily,  I have narrow feet. I ordered a size 8 1/2 and they fit.  It was a little snug across the in step of my foot. But after walking in them they fit with no problem.  So, if you have wide feet order a size up.  I'm happy I made this purchase and I'm definitely going to wear them on my bday! Ladies these shoes are definitely a must buy!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd"

    "message": "Saw these at Belk. they only had a size 7, 8 and 10. I normally wear a size 9 so I tried on the 8.  they were just about perfect but I was not wearing socks so I figured I needed an 8 1/2  since I would always be wearing socks with them.  When 8 1/2 arrived they were tight.  So Ordered a size 9 from Betsy Johnson's website because Belk was out of 9's.  they fit exactly like the size 8. I then bumped it way up to size 10 from Amazon. they were huge, exchanged them for 9 1/2.  They feel like a Wide Version.  there's too much room in the toe area and I can't get the laces tight enough.  My heels feel like they could slip out as I walk. Because the laces are so tight the toe area has a part that bumps out/up.  there is too much shoe trying to squeeze together. OH, They all were laced up backward from the way I lace my shoes.  I had to take out laces and do them my way.  Which is probably how everyone laces their shoes. I just gave up \ud83d\ude22 Glad there were many who actually got a pair that fit. Wearing size 9.5 in pic."
