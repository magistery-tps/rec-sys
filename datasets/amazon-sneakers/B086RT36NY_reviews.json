I ordered these new so how was the original box damaged? I've had these exact shoes before that I got at an actual store. So things that make me 95% positive these are fakes are that the toe area is hella tight and shallower than the rest of the shoe. Improperly tapered. Also, the laces aren't properly centered on the shoe. The outside has way more material reach than the inside, causing the uncenteredness. Even the toe itself isn't properly rounded. It is shaped incorrectly. Lastly, the shoe rocks and doesn't rest flat which it should if they were made at the quality they're supposed to be. The reasons I loved these shoes in the past was the eye appealing symmetry and shape, and extreme comfort. All of that is gone in these presumable fakes."
