I have been buying them for years because i know i can depend on the quality at a decent price. yes they also pop right into the washing machine and air dry in the sun. I always buy the Leather ones , we get a lot of rain here in NH . LOVE my Keds , 8.50 wide , thank you."

They are really cute; I like that they are a sort of leather-type material and not canvas, and the actual support of the shoe is comfortable, but they are tight for the size! Especially at the top of the foot. I don\u2019t usually have this issue with Keds, but these seem to fit a bit different. I would say to size up maybe a half size if you are getting the white leather shoes. I hope this helps!"

These are all that.  I also wanted a comfortable toe box and a fit that I wouldn't have to supplement with insoles and pads.  These are also, all that.  But...Do think carefully about the size you order!  I'm a pretty solid regular sz 10 but my toe area is a little wide.  After reading a bunch of reviews (and remembering another pair of Keds I own that are pretty narrow) I decided to order the 10 wide.  Perfection!!  I've never ordered a wide shoe in my life, but I may now! You might be wondering then why 4 not 5 stars?  Well, I have yet to wear them for more than 10 minutes so I can't yet comment on comfort or durability.  If I think of it, once I have, I'll update this later..."

    "message": "I've stuck with Keds for Double Deckers for the last 4-5 years. In no other shoe on earth have I had to wear a wide, but these shoes require it. I've gone through at least 7 pairs in various leather and suede colors. The last few years the quality and comfort have gone downhill. Steeply. My current perforated suede pair cuts the side and heels of my feet causing so much pain I had to stop wearing them. I simply couldn't break them in because the materials are so tough. Just awful. The black leather pair I just bought is at least the 4th in this style I've had. Purchased 5 days before getting on a plane to take care of a sick relative in late Feb 2022. Three days in, the white rubber portion of the sole started puckering. Embarrassingly, they started gaping in the days to follow with each step- but I was away from home with only these shoes. So to go back and forth running errands and caring for my relative (in other words- normal stuff, no marathons!) these shoes deteriorated within 7 weeks. SEVEN WEEKS! Finally, when I wore them in the rain, I took a step and the entire front of the shoe buckled underneath me. The rubber literally folded under my foot and pulled away from the leather. I'm lucky I didn't get injured. Never again, Keds. I've been wearing them for decades- and the double deckers which were my go-to shoes- for the last few years.  The love affair is over. I deserve better. And so do you. Don't waste your money on this fast fashion. To wear shoes casually for 7 weeks and have this happen is preposterous."

I would have liked a little more snug fit, but they do still fit my foot without falling off so I'll keep them. If you have a true narrow or even medium width foot, and receive a \"W\" width like I did, these may not work for you."

However, they were very uncomfortable, the \"foam\" insert was pretty hard and although I had the length correct the heels slipped off my feet to the point I was scrunching up my toes to keep them on. So here's the fix: I bought Dr Scholl's Memory foam inserts, cut them to fit and inserted them on top of the existing foam inserts. Then, I bought heel liners and put them in the heels of the shoes. Voila! Pretty comfy now, the heels don't slip and I can were them happily. I have a feeling I will be replacing the foam inserts and heel grips every so often and that probably added another $20 to the price. So if you find other shoes you like that cost a bit more I would probably go for that option in hindsight. I wear a size 6 and my foot is somewhat narrow but I don't usually have to buy narrow shoes."

When I got them in, I had to squeeze them onto my feet. Immediately, I joked with my husband and said, \"I guess I should have bought the wide style\". I have never had to by wide size shoes in my life. I have, what I would consider, a normal width foot. I still had hopes that MAYBE they would stretch out a bit. I wore them the next day and they were literally cutting the circulation off in my feet. Uncomfortable would be an understatement, it was miserable. I was wearing socks and also put bandaids on that morning just to be safe, still got blisters. This style is EXTREMELY and unnecessarily narrow. I honestly don't know how any one would comfortably wear them. It's a huge bummer, because I splurged on three pairs (all different colors) and was really excited to have them. So my review is, if you don't have straws for feet, buy the wide option. Judging by the width of the standard, there's a chance those may be a \"normal\" width. Keds should really give a heads up or measurements on their listing so this doesn't happen to other people."

They might slip even true fo size - but cannot comment fully on that. Still love the look & the price was half of any other brand that looked as well made. Very comfortable."

Both of the back of my heels are still healing from the shoes being so tight and rubbing on my heels. I still wear band aids when I wear them. I felt it would be too late to return them since i had been wearing them for a week already. ** It's been a month and I still wear bandaids on both of my heels. I'm hoping that one day it won't hurt to wear these shoes**"
