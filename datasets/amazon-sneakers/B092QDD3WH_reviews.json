Everyone thinks they are expensive Nike brand because they are so well put together. The tongue says \"LOVE\" which is awesome. I loved the first pair so much, I bought them all other colors except purple and white. The orange goes with my WNBA sweatshirt. It's a win win - Price you can't beat; quality and superfast shipment."

I was bummed because they claim they are \"true to size\" but I immediately got online to order a size up. Would liked to have been able to order a 10 1/2 but alas so many seller of shoes stop half sizes at 9 1/2 which is bizarre to me. Anyway, I got the size 11 today and immediately tried them because if I was going to return both I want to make one trip. As expected - the 11's are a tad too big, however - I would prefer a bigger sports shoe to a smaller one. So, I will be keeping the 11's and returning the 10's. So far (I wore them around the house today as I worked from home and they seem comfortable so far. I bought them to wear this weekend so hopefully, they are comfortable and last."

I'm comfortable and they feel like I'm wearing next to nothing. I'm definitely going to purchase more. These are a size 9. They are true to size, if you wear thick socks then I'd say order up a size. Due to the fitted style. I've gotten so many great compliments on this shoe. The material is comparable to that of a $200 dollar pair of Nikes if not better. I absolutely love my shoes."
