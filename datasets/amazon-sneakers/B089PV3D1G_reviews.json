It's not the kind of arch support you'd get in an athletic shoe, but it's definitely a bit more than you'll get out of many other flat sneakers (most flat sneakers have nothing and feel like you're walking on cardboard!). I am very sensitive to shoes without an arch, and this has just enough that I can wear these out with jeans or shorts and I do NOT come home in pain!  Highly recommend!"

    "message": "I came so close to returning these shoes after trying them on because they were pretty large on my feet. I've worn a size 8 in flats and athletic shoes for at least 2 decades, and the sizing on these shoes is different from any other European sized shoes. I didn't realize they were Euro size until I received them and the box read : EU 39 USW(women) 8 USM(ale) 61/2. As far as I've known, an 8 in women's is a 6 in boys or men's and a 39 European size is either an 8 1/2 or 9 translated to US size. I tried them on a third time because making a return is a bit of a hassle, and I decided to keep them. They are a little gappy and wide, but I like the look and style of them otherwise. My advice to anyone looking at these Supergas is do your research on sizing first and maybe get a half size smaller if your feet are not wide. If you've got wide feet, these are possibly the sneaker for you. They're great quality and such a sleek classic style casual shoe, so I still would recommend them!"

I wear an 8/39 in every brand of shoes but since I was unfamiliar with this brand, I second guessed based on the reviews and sized down to a 7.5. It was too short, but otherwise fit well and was surprisingly a little wide (I have a normal width foot). Sending back for the 39. Otherwise, super cute shoe and I can tell it will be extra comfy with the added width once I have the correct size."

I kept them anyway and have worn them a couple times with little sneaker socks. If you have wide feet then these will be great for you. I\u2019m having to pull the laces in so much to get them to fit the width of my feet that the front of the shoe is folding slightly. They have zero arch support, think flat converse style on the sole, so if you\u2019re looking for that you\u2019ll need insoles. Otherwise I do find them comfortable and they were a great price compared to a white casual leather sneaker I was considering."

NEW: Silver rings, Made in Mexico, and the heel logo is not nearly as crisply cut or defined. Also, the shoebox seems a bit wider and the material used is slightly stiffer. The stiffness could be due to them being new shoes though, so not too worried about that since they'll break down. At first, we thought it was a counterfeit product that was both shipped and sold by Amazon, but we emailed Superga and they confirmed they have manufacturing plans in Mexico, Vietnam, and other places of the world that they will pull wholesale inventory from when needed. OLD: Gold rings, Made in Vietnam, and the heel logo is crisp and looks like what you'd expect. These were bought a year ago directly from Superga themselves. All in all, if anyone sees a Mexico brand shoe from Amazon or other companies, so long as it's from a reputable sourced company like Amazon's own inventory it should be 100% legit without issue. Just seems quality control in different parts of the world, as would be expected, varies is all. Hope this helps any future person buying that has the same questions as we did."

I wore them exactly 4 times on vacation.  As we were leaving our first hotel, we had our suitcases and other bags on a luggage cart.  The bag of shoes was hanging from a hook on the cart above the suitcases.  These white shoes were on top since I had decided last minute not to wear them on a rainy day.  That night, after we had unloaded and were unpacking at our 2nd hotel stay, I found the shoes soiled with bird droppings!  The gull had to have placed a pinpoint accurate shot on my shoe bag.  Took me a day to surmise how that bird could have gotten the shoe but missed me.  The hanging shoe bag had to have been the scene of the crime.  And after seeing how accurately they hit statues and public landmarks while leaving most of the area around those site unfettered, I don't think it was an accident :-)  !!  Thank goodness my size was still available (with a bit of a savings!). I usually take an 8wide or an 8-1/2 wide.  If I can't get a wide width, going up to a 9 will often work depending on the toe box width.  Toe box width on this size 8-1/2 shoe is pretty wide as is the heel.  You'll need socks that cover the Achilles ankle or these will rub.  I'm not sure that a heel grip would stick to the canvas of this shoe.  I also have a bit of a hammer toe, so I wear gel cushion around my big toe.  The canvas seam is near the big toe joint and could be an irritant for this condition.  But the gel cushions work for me.  The canvas seems to stretch a bit after a few wears."

Few things to keep in mind: - It's a European brand, so it should be expected that it runs a little wide. If you have narrow feeties, expect some wiggle room in the toes. - That being said, I did NOT expect it to run large, too. I typically wear a size 10 US across any brand. For this brand, I had to size down. I sent back a size 10 and got a size 9.5, but to be honest I probably could have gotten away with a 9. - It's a heavy shoe, and it runs loose in the heel area (which is very interesting...). Unless you tie your laces to the point of cutting off circulation, your heel will be moving up and down with each step. Not the greatest, but not so annoying that I'd stop wearing these. Overall, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to order this again. And I certainly wouldn't pay over 50$ for it, so wait for the price to go down before you order."

The canvas is a bit stiff straight out of the box, as is the sole, but once you start walking, you can feel how comfortable they are.  I've worn them several times, and each time I wear them, they get more comfortable, not to mention they look great!  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5, the heel is a bit big, even when wearing no show socks, so there is a bit of slippage, but not enough for me to return the shoe.  Other than the heel, it does run a bit big.  Depending on the shoe style, I wear both an 8.5 and 9.  I ordered an 8.5, and they fit fine (besides the heel)."

The best fit for me was the Unisex 36, wms 6/mens 4.5. I also bought the woman\u2019s 6 but they were too narrow for me. I actually liked the wider toe box and that I could wear socks. Not sure if it makes a difference but the ones I kept were made in Mexico. The ones I am returning were made in Vietnam."

No where comparable to the comfort of Adidas Superstar, Sperry Crest Vibe, Vans Slides or Old Skool. They are worse than Keds Champion Original for comfort and quality. That\u2019s why I am not certain these are authentic. I\u2019ve not owned a paid before but I know people rave about them so I may have gotten a bad pair."

I thought it would go away but it hasn\u2019t. I still wear them but the squeak drives me a little nuts especially if walking alone in the quiet. Other than that I love them"

Can be worn with a suit on workday \u201cdress downs.\u201d  So glad I purchased them. Very supportive sole and great for walking and or gym days. A bit on the wide side; easily fixed with a sock."

What was a pleasant surprise was how comfortable and well made they were. I just wish I knew a good way to keep them clean as they are canvas. I have machine washed them twice and set them out in the sun to dry. They look pretty good after cleaning."

I did have to put slide grips in the heel of the shoes to keep them from rising up when I walk. If you have narrow feet these probably won\u2019t work for you, but if you suffer from ugly wide feet shaped like a loaf of bread you will be happy with these I hope the other colors will be available soon as I plan on buying more For reference, Skechers wide is too narrow. I have a pair of proper extra wide which fit well. I ordered these in a 71/2, and they fit!!"

    "message": "These shoes look exactly how I hoped they would, unfortunately after several wears they are squeaking relentlessly. I had hoped this would go away as they break in but I think it's actually getting worse. They squeak on wood, on cement, on carpet- every surface, nonstop. I do also have to warn that they seem to be about a half size to a full size too big. I'm usually a 7.5, occasionally an 8 in narrower shoes, so I ordered a 7.5. Unfortunately, these are pretty loose on me. Not unwearable, but definitely not a perfect fit. I'd recommend sizing at least a half size down."

    "message": "I didn't know if I liked the fit originally so I padded around my house for a bit.  The toe box is large and I thought my toe brushed the end of the shoe - I switched to normal thickness socks and found them to be perfect.  I have since worn them all day and found them to be rather comfy.  The toe box is rather roomy and they pretty much run true to size.  These are a woman's shoe and not a unisex.  I wear an 8.5-9 so I ordered an 8.5 and that was perfect - not snug, but a roomy 8.5.  I will purchase more in the future as they are a universal shoe that really can be worn with anything"

When I went to exchange them, there was no 6.5 available so tried a 7. Huge!!!! Checked to see if a 6.5 was now available and it was. So ... third time lucky except that the 6.5 is still really big. I have thick Dr. Scholl's inserts and heel grips to stop my heels from coming out of the shoes. I also have to tighten the laces as much as possible as the sneakers are high as well as wide. These wouldn't work for a narrow foot. I'll persevere and I think they'll be OK. They're really retro/cute and make my teeny feet look normal."

Reminds me of the quality I used to get from Keds years ago before they got cheap. Canvas is heavy duty and the rubber soles really hold up. The construction is quality also. I washed them in the washing machine multiple times with no damage at all. I do air dry. The white above is my second pair only because I wanted a more summer color. The original pair ( 3 years old) are still great, look just as good as the day I bought them. Well worth every penny."

It's a shame. I was going to replace my other pair but now I'm afraid to do so and have the same thing happen..."
