I'd say these fit pretty well considering they aren't marketed to either. Arch support isn't as good as the standard clog, but I didn't have any back pain after wearing them which is a win in my book. In fact, I just bought a pair in mens for my husband."

    "message": "I wanted to be cautious and wait to right this review. It\u2019s been over 4 months now, so here we go. I was one of many people that rolled my eyes when Crocs first showed up. I still can\u2019t stand the look of the garden shoe style but I now understand that these shoes are accessibility aids! They actually help many people with all sorts of conditions with their feet! My problem: I started working a job in a building with hard, tiled floors after years of being away from carpeted retail floors. I\u2019m fat (love that I am). My feet hurt so bad every night that I had to take hot foot baths everyday \u2014and they still hurt bad enough afterward. I found myself hurting so much I was having trouble falling asleep because my feet were in such pain! What I tried: I was wearing Dr. Scholls and tried every foot insert they offered from the overweight women type, the plantar fasciitis type, etc. They\u2019re garbage and a waste of money. These Crocs: I bought both these and the nursing shoe type of crocs in a size 10. The fit and feel of the LiteStride was the better of the two for my job. The nursing shoe type had a platform and felt a little large so it rolled on my foot and didn\u2019t feel secure or like it wrapped around my foot. My feet hurt after wearing that nurse one. The Lite Stride breathed. It was sturdy and the shoe didn\u2019t roll around my foot if I accidentally stepped on my outstep. And the fit was very good and felt secure on my feet. Then the material that the sole is made out of brought me the most unbelievable relief. My feet have not hurt one day since wearing the lite strides! I didn\u2019t add inserts either! Downside: Don\u2019t walk through puddles or spill anything on your feet. The shoe has holes. Overall: Buy these. You deserve to be comfortable while you work."

    "message": "I love how these look, they're everything I was looking for in a walking shoe. The color, the design, and cushioning are all fine. However, I must point out the fact that these fit me comfortably without socks, but when I wear socks they're a bit snug and the rubber inside makes it hard for your foot to slip in with socks which is super strange in a sneaker. Maybe I should have ordered a bigger size? But the length is perfect, so i don't know. I bought these looking for shoes to wear socks with. I live in Florida, so this is a real issue for me. As Floridians we tend to default to flip flops when at home or even outside because it's so hot all the time that's all you feel like wearing. Since I work from home this has become my every day shoes which is terrible for dry, cracked feet. So I wanted shoes that were comfortable enough that will motivate me to wear socks more for my dry/cracked feet. The reality with these for me is Without socks = sweaty, hot feet, if it's really hot outside, which is common here. With socks \ud83e\udde6 = too tight, almost claustrophobic get-me-out-of-these-shoes-now feeling. The rubber bottom makes it feel weird with socks too, like you can't scrunch your toes there, it's just not that comfy feeling you get when you're wearing a fabric-lined-bottom sneaker. So I'm left with a dilemma that makes me not want to wear them most of the time....I really wanted these to become my go-to shoes \ud83d\udc5f In reality they'll probably be my \"sometimes\" shoe."

    "message": "I hate normal sneakers. All the bulky padding at the top feels claustrophobic and is easily made disgusting by sweat or water. The foot beds are always mediocre, and putting good insoles in them only makes the shoe even tighter and stuffier. I wear sneakers for hiking and general outdoor stuff and they get disgusting if they get wet, which is unavoidable. I love fashionable light colors but they get ruined even walking only in the city. These crocs sneakers solve literally all my problems with sneakers. The top feels a lot like silicone, but I don\u2019t know what it actually is. The sole is a firm crocs EVA and the footbed...ooooooh the footbed!!! LiteRide is incredible. I don\u2019t like squishy shoes. I like THESE squishy shoes. Extremely comfortable and felt just as great after a 3 mile walk as they did when I first put them on. Unlike other cushioned footbeds, these are EVA so they don\u2019t get wet with sweat etc and thus remain nice and springy. The top of the shoe having no padding and being VERY ventilated is great. I can wear them with socks without feeling like my feet are swaddled in a duvet, and I can wear them without socks without worrying about ruining them. I wore these in some muddy conditions and the mud washed right off. Light colored sneakers that won\u2019t get stained by dirt?? YES. And I can just hose them off without hurting them or having wet shoes the next day. No need to wonder if the washing machine & dryer are going to destroy the glue. My foot is a size 7 in length but I sized up since I have a high arch that often makes shoes tight. The 8 fits great with room in the front so I would say they fit true to size. I probably could have gone with a 7, and I would if I were going to wear without socks. Without socks I would want a 7, but with socks the 8 fits comfortably. The tongue is thin and a quick drying fabric. There is a strip  of the same fabric around the opening. This would make them comfy without socks, no rubber edge rubbing your ankles. I have never really loved a pair of sneakers before now!! The only thing I would ever change would be to add a better sole. The crocs sole is great for the gym and sidewalk, but I find it a little slick everywhere else. I don\u2019t expect crocs to make a lugged trail running sole or anything, but even a normal outdoor running sole would be just a little better. I will probably be modifying the sole myself."

I was worried about the rain because of the holes in the top but that was surprisingly not an issue. I wore them through a rain storm and puddles with socks on and my socks were nice and dry! These are great travel shoes and these are now my favorite go to shoes for vacation and work. The only bad thing: the material of the inside of the shoe makes it difficult to wear with socks because it rides up the sock, causing it to be tight around the toes and bunch around the heel, so I had to learn to figure that out. It took a good while, but I have system for it now."

I like that i have extra room in the toes...some shoes were causing my toes to totally fall asleep while wearing them, these do not.  The support seems to be ok so far, i am not running, just walking in them so not sure how they would do if you actually ran in them but the impact for a heavy set person walking is pretty good.

I wear a true 8, so luckily I didn't need a half size. I ordered the 8 (also, \"Pearl White\" is a light grey and white trim and I love them!). They fit a bit tight, but needed to be broken in. I wore them on a day off with ankle socks- do not recommend. There is a tiny trim of fabric on the inside lining that can rub your heel. I wore them for a 10 hour shift at work with crew socks and they did better. No heel pain. So you do need to break them in a bit. I also wear thin socks (yes I know it's December...)and it's a tight fit to get your foot into the shoe because of the inside of the shoe itself. The foam bottom is nice and feels great- but it's more effort to get your foot into. That may just be me, though. I loosened the shoelaces so it fits more to my foot. Overall, I do recommend these. They're light, airy. I don't mind the tiny holes, as I'm on my feet ALL DAY and I like to be cooled off. I gave 4 stars just for the tight fit and the lining of fabric around the ankle that kind of rubs your heel. I'm on day three of wearing them at work, and I do love them. I'll get another pair if these prove well over the next few months. Edit: I wear them everyday! It's still a tight fit when you first put them on but after a few minutes they become comfortable. I did get the pearl white and I now have some blue staining on the shoes that I can't get off (I wear blue scrubs!!!) So walking in the rain (yay curbside) wet scrubs = rubs the color on the shoes. It's not a dealbreaker though, since I just wear them for work. They're still light and comfortable, and my definite go-to shoe everyday for work. I do still recommend crew socks, since the fabric trim catches and pulls socks down into your shoe lol. It could still just be me though. 9/10!"

But I walk a different path than most! I initially bought these for the Sole purpose to be comfortable standing long periods of time (10+ hrs at work). I have flat feet and over pronation because of it. In the past, I\u2019ve had plantar fasciitis. I\u2019m resigned to say that no shoe has ever been comfortable to wear after a few ours. This is a very nice shoe, it\u2019s mate, basic/classic shoe design, and familiar crocs design (holes); and I believe you could probably wear these with any casual outfit. When I initially tried them on, I wore socks. So with the croc material against the fabric; there was some resistance with sliding my foot in. So I untied the shoe strings; which are thin (tho understandable because it was design to be lightweight and comfortable.) Im glad I got them one size bigger, because with the sock or not, it was a bit snug. I even loosened the shoe string which helped a little bit. When standing, it felt okay, still a little snug around the arch/heel of my foot. Walking around, it felt loose in the front of the shoe. [My heel felt cradled (if you know what I mean by that) it was comfortable.] Tho after two hours of standing/walking, I felt discomfort in the arch of my foot. But for standing 10 hours it did not rise up to the occasion. A little disappointed. But I do think this is the cute shoe I\u2019ve seen Crocs have. It has medium arch support. Shoe laces are thin and made for show. Not good in puddles or rain btw! I\u2019ll hang on to these tho for now!"

I spend a lot of time on my feet at work and not wearing a good supportive shoe was wreaking havoc on me. I purchased the regular Crocs clogs for use at home to see if I liked them. The clogs were super comfy, so I bought these sneakers to wear to work. They're very comfortable and squishy and I can go all day without getting pain in my heels or my hips. They're made of a light-weight foam or rubber and the outside has little holes in it for air flow. They're super light, my feet don't get sweaty or slip around, and I can wear them comfortably without socks (this was a big plus, since I don't like socks). They look very nice on, like a higher-end sneaker, and you can't tell they're not fabric. RE sizing: I purchased the Crocs original clog in a size 10 and noted that it had a lot of room in the toe. After reading comments on the sneaker, I ordered a size 9. I usually wear somewhere between 9 and 10 but Crocs doesn't do half sizing. The 9 fit well in the toe but was way, WAY too small across the top of my foot. After wearing them for less than 30 minutes, I was in pain and had to take them off. There was just no way they were going to work, even if they did happen to stretch a bit. I returned them and purchased a size 10. The 10s are slightly too big in the toe, but I don't notice it at all while I'm on my feet. More importantly, I can lace them up without the tongue digging into the top of my foot and causing pain. I do think they stretched out a little bit, but not enough to make them too big."

I got these for a Disneyland trip but ended up trying them at Legoland first; @chasingmagicdaily raves about these and she did not disappoint! These are soo light and comfortable. You can wear these with or without socks! If these are comfortable at a theme park, they\u2019re definitely good enough to go on walks, runs, etc."

They are a slimming shoe and look good even in my office wear.  I will warn to look out for shoe defect.  Mine came with a little glue on them.  I just got these shoes yesterday and noticed the glue today after already wearing to work.  I don\u2019t think I can return now so just be careful with that. It\u2019s not very noticeable."

I just bought a replacement as some of the color was worn on my original pair. I wash them every week in my washing machine with a Clorox sanitizing rinse. The arches wore down after about a year requiring inserts, but after 48 hours a week wear that was understandable."

I love crocs as they seem to be the only brand that help minimize pain felt in feet, knees and overall legs caused by fibromyalgia and arthritis.  However, I refuse to wear the clogs out of vanity. Lol. But these fit the bill. Also ordered a pair of their flip flops, which are also very forgiving.  Highly recommend. Especially if you suffer from chronic pain like I do."

There is absolutely nothing plush about this shoe. Having developed posterior tibial tendinitis standing for 10 hours on my job I have been on a search for something that would support my arches but also give me cushion and comfort at the heel. This is not it. There is NO arch support and that little bumpy, rubber insole really doesn\u2019t have much give or thickness. I mean, the shoe is basically flat. I was expecting a nice , plush, springy, cushiony insole based on what they describe. The shoe is not uncomfortable it\u2019s just if you have any foot issues and need something with a good support and comfort factor these aren\u2019t it. If they could make a closed in work shoe with the EXACT SAME foot bed as either their original clog or their water sandal I\u2019d be set. But this shoe is just ok."

Wife and I bought them (yeah I bought the women's size equivalent for myself). I have Plantar pain and it has relieved a lot of the pain. I use them 40 hours a week. They are so flexible enough that I feel it allows my arch muscle to strengthen and hence reduced my pain. Sadly they are already wearing a bit after a months use but I walk 7000 to 10000 steps a day. If they wear out I will buy another set. They dirty quickly in the white but they wash super easily. Best feature is they get wet you wipe them out and put on a new sock and now you have dry feet again. Great for those who work in the  Florida parks. I get lots of compliments and love my shoes great buy. Update 1/29/21: shoes finally wore a holes in them after 149 days and about 894 miles in them. Still love the shoes because of comfort and the fact it help build the strength in my feet and my plantar fasciitis has not hurt as bad since I got the shoes. Just wish the sole would have lasted longer. But I just got a new set and still love them. My wives shoes are still in good condition because she does not wear them as much as I did mine."

I tried them on and wow, they\u2019re soooo comfortable and fit the shape of my foot well! I was afraid that the texture of the shoes would make it fit looser but it is tight and very well fitting. I ran around my house and they stay comfortably. The bottom of the shoe has small bumps that are actually very cushiony! They attached a small piece of the bottom to show a sampling of the bottom of the shoe which was nice as I did not know what to expect. I\u2019ve worn them for about 1 hour now and they get more comfortable the longer you wear it. I bought them for my new job as an art teacher and wanted something comfortable and easy to clean. I poured water on it and it will go through the holes but it wipes right off the shoe. I will be an art on a cart teacher so I\u2019ll be on my feet all day and am so looking forward to wearing these!! These would also make great hiking or walking shoes as they are breathable and easy to clean. I would highly recommend them at the moment!"

They are super light and comfortable on the feet. But, if you are funny about how your socks sit on your feet like I am, you may not like them. They are difficult to put on if you have socks. The material of the inside pulls my socks up when I put them on, making them tight on my toes. Because of the flexibility of the shoe, it is a tiny bit harder to get the back of the shoe on than it is other shoes. The sides of the shoes have rubbed my baby toes raw. I thought these shoes would keep my feet more cool because of the holes. With my shoe covers on at the hospital, my feet are actually more hot than they are in my normal shoes. They may be better to use on other floors instead of covid"
