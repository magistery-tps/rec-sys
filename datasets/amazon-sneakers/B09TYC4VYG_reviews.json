I need this because I spend so much time outside and I take long walks for exercise. I have had the soles of shoes wear out quickly due to  time spent walking outside especially on hard areas. This brand seems to last longer and better."

So, she was thrilled to find them in a random Ladies wear catalog for $59\u2026and promptly ordered them in a size 6M.  Unfortunately, they were too small for her\u2026.and was about to send them back and \u201cwait\u201d for who knows how long to re-send her a larger shoe in 6.5M\u2026that is, until I said I\u2019d \u201ccheck on Amazon\u201d to see what they have\u2026and found that very size 6.5M for $47 she needed\u2026and promptly placed the order, which came 2-days later as promised. She tried them on and loved how comfortable they felt\u2026..and then I noticed that the box said 6.5M\u2026\u2026and the shoes said 7M. Well, they did fit her..she\u2019s a very tiny person with a small foot, so we were both surprised they fit. This is why I\u2019m only giving 4 stars instead of 5\u2026.(can I say 4.75?) because the box was marked incorrectly and it could have turned out to be another frustrating wait for yet another shoe size\u2026..but it wasn\u2019t\u2026and she loved them. The end. :)"
