These Sperry camo sneakers are green and brown with a bit of gold bling.  They look great with casual pants/jeans.  I've worn them everywhere and they stay looking clean."

Compared to the Keds, these are heavier and don't breathe as well. The sides of the tongue want to fold under, so I have to be aware of that when I put them on. I think I will be okay wearing these over the fall and winter with socks but I will find a better replacement for my Keds Sandy."

My shoe size ranges from 8.5 to 9 in most shoes.  I still had some trouble getting them on even sizing up, but once I did they were comfortable. The laces are not real functional and I couldn't loosen them without unknotting them.  For everyday walking around, these are probably good enough.  But I expected more. They appear to have a thick sole, but feel just like any other flat shoe I have. I was hoping for something closer to a tennis shoe. I ended up switching to my Tom's for most of the trip.  For the cost, I'll stick with Tom's for my casual shoes."
