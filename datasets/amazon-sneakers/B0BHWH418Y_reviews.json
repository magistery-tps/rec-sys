The shoes fit nicely however my only complaint is that the opening for your foot is tight. My foot does not easily slide into the shoe and I have to wiggle my foot into them which could be a big issue if you have large ankles and/or wide ankles. The shoe laces are false and only for design. You actually cannot widen the opening by adjusting the laces."

It's difficult to describe, not a deal breaker but definitely not signs of a well-manufactured shoe either. Getting stains off it is nice and easy if you use Shout and throw it in the wash but then you risk removing the glue from the shoe."

    "message": "I bought these shoes specifically for doing clinicals  at my school. It\u2019s also my first time buying shoes on Amazon, so I was a bit iffy about purchasing items like these on here in regards to fit, etc. First- the shoes are very light, not heavy at all, the material is breathable, but due to them being so light they don\u2019t offer much support. Bad things- they feel cheaply made, some of the areas on the front you can almost see a little leakage from the glue that was used to seal so not exactly esthetically pleasing but since they\u2019re all black not super noticeable. Also, I thought these shoes were just a quick slip in and out, no they still have laces, which I didn\u2019t like because I wanted a shoe without laces and the looks of it this looked like that style. Last- I\u2019m a size 6, and even with a no show sock it\u2019s a bit tight- like it leaves marks tight. Obviously I have worn it, so it\u2019s past my return time and I wouldn\u2019t return a worn item but maybe go up another half size if you\u2019re concerned it may run small because it really does. I would buy it again if there weren\u2019t any other options. Next time I\u2019ll purchase shoes in store though, there\u2019s nothing like actually trying it on and seeing how it fits to make a decision."

They have changed the type of insole to a more permanent, thicker insole more molded to the shoe.  It does not appear to come out easily.  However, it is a tad bit narrower than the inside of the shoe.  Although I don't ever need a wide width, the inside of the foot bed felt too narrow for my foot.  When I stand and walk, I feel the edge of the thick padding in the middle of my small and large toes....as if they are hanging off.  I love the shoe and don't know if the wide might be better. The outside of the shoe is a bit different material than the older version.  It is a little shiny looking and feels much smoother.  It's not like the cotton feel of the past pair.  I think this will be better allowing for the shoe to be surface cleaned more easily.  I had a lighter color and have had to wash it many times!"

They fit well (snug, appropriate size) and look great!  However, the memory foam sole falls VERY short of what I expected. First of all, the sole doesn\u2019t go all the way to the toe end of the shoe, which is just weird... You can feel where the sole stops by your toes instead of filling out the bottom of the shoe like they should. It is a suuuuper thin sole with minimal support. It\u2019s a comfortable foam, but you need a few centimeters more in thickness for it to be any amount of support.  What I have found through lots of searching, is that isn\u2019t uncommon. It\u2019s extremely hard to find a good looking shoe with good support. I am buying a memory foam insole to make up for it, and I\u2019m sure with that addition it will be perfect.  Great for working out, short shopping trips or walks around the neighborhood, but not the best support for long lengths of time. Overall an awesome shoe, but definitely found it needs more support."

My feet are a little wide so I tend to size up a half size, but you don\u2019t need to in these! But the way they are designed, they don\u2019t slip off the heel, so they work just fine! This is my second pair, I will keep purchasing because I have such a hard time finding comfortable gym shoes and these are perfect!"
