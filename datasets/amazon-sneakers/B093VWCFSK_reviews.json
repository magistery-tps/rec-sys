I\u2019d have to go up another half size to remedy the fit lengthwise. I have to return them, though, mainly because the whole toe box area was *tight*.

They're incredibly comfortable (super insanely cushiony insoles) and totally hold up on long, rainy, soggy walks to the metro.  I first got a pair in blush and loved them so much I bought a second pair of blush sneakers and a pair in peacoat. <3  Honestly, if it wasn't for the shutdown and losing two-thirds of my paycheck, I'd order a pair in silver!  The picture is of the first pair of blush with a purse I had gotten earlier (didn't realize until then that I kind of have a thing for pink...)
