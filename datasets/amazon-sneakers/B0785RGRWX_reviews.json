I\u2019ve been wearing these shoes daily for a month now and I can\u2019t say enough good things about them. I\u2019m so satisfied I bought the Harman Work shoes for work too. I\u2019ve been a die hard Newbalance fan for years and always bought that brand but Reebok managed to top them both comfort and affordability. I have a new favorite shoe brand. Highly recommend!"

After using them a few times, I realized that they are probably my most comfortable shoes due to the cushion. I was in a hurry and had to run in them a couple of times and they felt great. Although I purchased them purely for aesthetics, they are very functional. I'm thinking of buying a pair just for walking/jogging. I'm a size 9 and they fit as expected. They feel a bit more narrow than other shoes like adidas or nike, but not as bad as vans or pumas."

First off, it is very hard to find a name brand, pair of SNEAKERS\u201d, with a \u201cBROWN\u201d, colorway! Pick any, \u201cBRAND\u201d or pick any, \u201cMODEL\u201d, of sneaker and go, see if they have that sneaker with a \u201cBROWN\u201d, colorway?! ..... \u201cGOOD LUCK\u201d! I just unboxed this sneaker and man, they are a thing of beauty! I must own 10 to 12 pairs of Reebok sneakers already! However, with the exception of my Fluid Blue Reebok Classics in leather and my Maroon Reebok Club C 85 sneakers, I purchased months ago, these are the \u201cBEST\u201d, looking REEBOKS, I have in my sneaker collection and that\u2019s \u201cNOT\u201d, because they\u2019re new! It\u2019s because of their look, their color and their design! I can\u2019t wait to wear them outdoors! On my feet though, they feel comfortable, just like all Reebok sneakers tend to feel! So, I have no doubt I will be totally satisfied once I break them in, \u201cFULLY\u201d, at some point! This particular version is incredibly hard to find in a decent size, too! So, if you\u2019re into sneakers like I am, I would advise you to jump on them now, while they\u2019re still available and \u201cBEFORE\u201d, the season changes! They\u2019re worth every penny, in my opinion and bring something, \u201cUNIQUE\u201d, to your footwear wardrobe! \u201cTRUST ME\u201d, I get compliments all the time about my shoes and sneakers! Purchasing sneakers like this is \u201cONE\u201d, of the reasons why? I would recommend them to anyone for purchasing, you \u201cCAN\u2019T\u201d, go wrong! They\u2019re a, \u201cGEM\u201d!"

I have to say that these were JUST WHAT I HOPED FOR! I usually tie my shoes on the second loop on shoes unless they're hiking boots. Sometimes this makes the shoe too loose for some, but it was placed just right. NOT TOO TIGHT around the ankles and NOT SLIPPING OFF my heel, JUST PERFECT! Also, the sole gives just enough padding where my FOOT FITS SNUG and DOESN'T SLIP around in the shoe. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, AND DEFINITELY WOULD BUY AGAIN! *caps weren't meant for shouting, just emphasis, Cheers!"

I did get an 8.5 in the men size, as that would be the size in comparison. I may have been able to take an 8, as I had a little room in my toe top part in the 8.5. I figure if I have socks on then the fit will be fine, as it\u2019s not unfitting with no socks. I plan to get this brand in others styles as well."
