The first time I bought from DSW and I believe they were my true size (7.5). After reading the comments on Amazon I bought a half size up (8) and im very thankful I did because they fit perfectly. These are great to wear for errands and walking. If you are looking to run in these or lift weights I do not suggest buying these and looking from running/training shoes instead. My takeaways are 1. Order a half size up from your true size 2. These shoes are not meant to handle heavy cardio/weight oriented work outs 3. I am in love with the way they look"

These are a women\u2019s 11 and my toes stop just a centimeter before they\u2019d be jammed up to the tip. Being that they are stretchy fabric these still work and I wear them often. They will wear out fast bc the memory foam insole doesn\u2019t seem to be a high enough density to support all day wear multiple times a week. But I like the look and they are great for working at an elementary school where I can\u2019t wear \u201csneaker sneakers\u201d due to dress code. If the outside holds up I may put in an insert when the insole is done."

The rubber tread on the bottom is very thin, which allows the shoe to be light but I wouldn\u2019t use it harshly outdoors as I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s gonna tear that bottom down quickly. Much thinner than my Nike running shoes. They breathe nicely and are true to size, toe box a little tighter than I\u2019m used to but not uncomfortable. Overall a nice light workout shoe."

I normally wear 9.5W and I feel these might fit a bit more generously than most of other 9.5W shoes or booties I have bought and I wear slightly thick socks with sneakers (yes, even in summer). I think you could size down about 1/2 size actually. Depending on longevity (i'll try to re-review these in 3-6 months) I will repurchase in a 9W. Could use a little more arch support but these are the most comfy sneakers i've bought in the better part of 18 months (in store or online)."

    "message": "I ordered up a half size as many reviewers suggested.  It was a wise decision as I\u2019ve plenty of room and the toe box is accommodating. Super super comfortable but the lack of support will keep these shoes in the closet for walking any distance. They are great for around the house or a short walk with the dog. I\u2019ve owned many a pair of NewBalance and while these are clearly the most comfortable I cannot depend on them to not leave my feet/arches aching after a long day on my feet."

They're not that \"squishy\" but they're closer to the floor, which I like. They're also great for spin cycling."
