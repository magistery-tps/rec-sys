At first, they can feel snug on the foot, but they eventually formed to my foot and no longer caused me any discomfort. The only downside is the scuff marks. The office I work in has white floors and I noticed that I was leaving scuff marks behind. They easily are removed, but something to point out! Overall, I receive compliments all day long and love the way they look."
