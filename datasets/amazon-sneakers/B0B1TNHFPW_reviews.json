Usually the $60-$80 shoes end up breaking down over a 3 month period but these lasted past that (and probably would have lasted longer if my puppies hadn't found them lol.) Definitely worth the buy, it fit really well and I had almost no problems breaking them in + they had enough cushion that at the end of the day my feet weren't even sore for once."

I've tried dozens of sneakers from Oofos, OrthoFoot and Hooka to Sketchers, Brooks and Merrill. Nothing felt comfortable. UNTIL THESE!!! They fit the bill! They have great cushioning, just enough height in the heel. Plenty of room in the toe box and they provide a lot of stability for my poor tired ankles with the wide sole. I did replace the insole with my favorite insole from Dr. Sholl's for even more cushioning but its not necessary. These sneakers have quite a bit. Am I totally pain free? No. I never will be. But I can actually walk without limping now and for more than 10 minutes at a time. I normally take a 7.5 or 8. Went with the 8s. They run a little wide but nothing socks or pulling the laces tight can't fix. I highly recommend at least trying them!!"

The other pair had the bill sewn in and no reel heel so I had to tie it extreeeemly tight to make sure it stayed on. With this pair it had a separate piece for the bill and a heel which is a big plus for me ( low standards.) the shoes are nice and comfortable and if you have planar faciitis just take the sole out and put in ur schols or whatever. 8/10 Would probably buy again."
