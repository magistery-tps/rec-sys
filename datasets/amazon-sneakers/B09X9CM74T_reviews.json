Not too tight in the toe, laces secure my feet but do not hurt them. No issues with slipping. Not to mention the color is so vibrant. I get So many compliments on these shoes. The insole is Great. Soft and supportive. So glad I bought them. \ud83d\udc9b I prefer a Womens size 11, so I bought a Mens 9 and they are perfect."

Be aware, they run almost two sizes too small. I wear a men's 8.5, but had to return them for a 9, which are still borderline too small. I will keep them, but will need to wear very thin socks."

    "message": "I've gotta do a few 2-3 mile walks in these in the next few days to see how they pan out, but right out of the box, the fit, quality, look and support are incredible. My foot profile is pretty simple. I'm 6ft 3, and my feet are quite thin from top to bottom, ...but also kinda that crazy torpedo shape from heel to toe tall guys get. NB has almost always worked the best for my foot profile. They're good at not OVER doing the padding features in the wrong areas for my feet, while adding a TON of support to the downforce areas. I also love the simple top design...very breathable, plenty of room but not too loose, and a very accommodating toe end, which flexes and adjusts to my wider top foot profile the more I use the shoes. Other shoes, I've found can have better support, more padding, etc...but either my feet can't breathe, they sweat too much and start chaffing my upper and lower foot (which leads to blistering), they start pissing off my lower middle foot from too much padding, or they're just plain constrictive feeling and way too hot in terms of everyday wearability. I'm hoping these work out, if not, i'm pretty sure another model of NB will work fine after some trial and error. I also love the fact NB offers \"wide\" profile shoes as well as standard. These are sneakers, not dress shoes, and that's a next level offering for someone like me. Regardless, NB deserves a gold medal in terms of affordable, high end, carefully researched sneakers. PS...this is coming from an ex \"Vintage to Vintage Reissue Nike Air ONLY\" sneaker lover. Unfortunately, I got old, ...so I can still collect those beauties, I just can't wear'em 14 hours a day nonstop on my feet."
