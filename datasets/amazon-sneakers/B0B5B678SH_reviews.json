Also ordered a whole size up to ensure comfort and correct sizing. My feet barely hurt..  I sometimes wear on my off days when quick run to the store. Only downside some of the black coloring becoming brownish near the logo but it's hardly noticeable."

    "message": "Let me tell you about these shoes.  These run about 1/2 size too small. The width is accurate; however it is necessary to get the proper width because they don't give and relax like leather shoes .  The synthetic leather is sewn over a non giving Inner  \"shoe\".  That firm inner liner gives these gym shoes a lot of support and structure.  These will hold their shape for the life of the shoes.  They are very sturdy.  There is a band around the front of the shoe.  That gives additional structure.  They have a cushioned insole.  They have good arch support.  It supports exactly where it should on the arches. The tongue is padded and the heel area is padded.  The laces aren't overly long.  The gym shoes are lightweight.  On the feet, they look like good leather gym shoes.  They don't get those ugly creases in them. The insole is comfortable.  The synthetic leather is soft, but that is not felt because it is sewn over that inner shoe. The inner liner is soft, but firm.  The top of the shoe, before the laces have some \"play\".  That one area is softer. The rest of the  shoe is firm, non giving and will stay that way by design.  That's why getting the proper width is important.  The feet feel very supported.  These are nothing like those popular mesh gym shoes. Now, there are  two sole attached to these shoes. The first is flexible.  The second is not. It does not give.  It feels hard while walking.  The second sole is the one that is treaded.  It is deeply treaded These shoes are not for running.  For anyone that has lost a lot of knee cartilage just know the last sole is  hard and inflexible.  If it wasn't,  these would be an absolute dream come true for anyone with knee issues.  Since it is so firm, initially they don't maneuver  easily in all directions while walking.  That's important for anyone with knee problems. They do absorb shock  and have lots of cushioning. The entire sole is almost 2\".  They are well worth trying, because they absorb so much shock and pressure off the knees  while walking. Note the photos;  the heel is designed so that  wearer has to heel strike first.  It's not an option. That is the proper way to begin walking.  That takes further pressure off the knee joint......I'm a Massage Therapist. I really don't think you will find a better shock absorbing shoe.  The more you walk in them the more thick cushioned sole is felt; the less the hard sole is felt,  and the feet are able to adjust to movement in all directions.  When first trying them on they just feel so hard.  That leaves after about a day of wearing.  After first trying them on my initial reactions was to send them right back.  Don't get discouraged when first trying them on.  Give them a chance. The knees will thank you. This is a good pair of shoes for people without knee problems for sure.  These make good works shoes  and they really look attractive, too.  I love the way they look, especially the all white.  It's a bright true white.  They look so fresh.  They make a nice  dress up gym shoe for me.  I know I'm glad I found them and I hope this review helps someone else. I purchased the white and black. For whatever reason the black runs a little smaller than the white.  I noticed that is true of Reebok's Princess Lite shoe as well."

I follow an online fitness instructor at home (shout out to #CDornerFitness) who does a variety of classes ranging from step aerobics to weight training to HIIT and Tabata style classes.  These shoes are perfect for everything.  Super cushioned and supportive, for step, but strong enough, thanks to the faux leather material, that they can hold up to moves like wall sits and planks that push your toes forward; I never feel like I'm going to rip a hole through the front or hurt myself if I accidentally drop a weight.  I have a narrow foot, and so many sneakers are too wide for me.  I'm pretty much a size 7 in every shoe for every occasion, and this shoe is no different.  7 was just right, and I don't have to tighten the laces to the max to be comfortable on my narrow-ish foot.  I love the retro style (I got black), and I super love that they are cruelty-free.  They DID have a strong chemically smell for the first few days, but that has long gone.  I've basically worn them every day for a year and they are holding up great.  The only sport I would not wear them for is running, although, admittedly, I haven't tried them running....."

    "message": "In the late 80s and early 90s I lived in high-top Reeboks that I found super comfortable. For some reason these Reeboks seem to lack the cushion I was expecting and my soles ache when I wear them because the insoles feel hard and ungiving. I still gave them 4 stars because they are well made and it might be that they need to be broken in, and might also be because I haven't worn shoes with a lot of support lately. I have an old pair of New Balance tennies that are very broken in and comfortable, and I've been wearing comfortable canvas slip ons as a shoe of choice that are more like wearing slippers in how comfortable they are, but they're probably comfortable due to little support (?). I'm guessing these are the reasons the Reeboks feel hard and ungiving, because I also got a pair of Sketcher slip ons (via Amazon) a few months back, and those were also not as comfortable as I expected, so I put gel insoles in them and that felt much better. So maybe I've just gotten used to shoes that don't have a lot of support and that's why I'm giving these Reeboks the benefit of the doubt, and hope once I get used to the support and they also break in some, they'll feel more like my old high tops of days past."

They have that angled heel and toe which make walking easier and more fluid, which I imagine is great for the knees and hips. I don't think I would recommend them for working out though. The platform of the sneaker sole is a little high (think, Skechers Shape Ups) and I would be afraid of landing wrong and twisting an ankle. It if you're doing lots of running, crossfit, jumping, plyometrics, etc. Anyway, they're super cute, I think they're genuine, and they fit great. I usually wear a size 7.5 in all major sneaker brands with my left foot being ever so slightly smaller than the right. These fit just as expected. I received two other models of similar Reeboks as A Try Before You Buy order and neither of them seemed like genuine Reeboks by comparison to this one. Sizing was off, and quality was not as good."

From the first second I put them on they felt just right. That's because ... They don't rub against my pinky toe. The back doesn't stick up too high and rub against the achilles! Cushioning around the ankle is nice. They don't rub or poke anywhere. These shoes are comfortable enough to wear all day, cute enough that I don't have to change my shoes to go to the store, and comfortable so I can get up anytime and go for a walk. FYI - the arch support is moderate, not really high on the inside. SIZING - I normally wear a 7.5 but like my tennis shoes a little bigger. I got an 8. It's just right because I like a thicker sock - I would say these run true to size, which is I have found to be extremely unusual for tennis shoes! A 7.5 would have likely worked, too. Only possible negative is that the white sidewalls might get dirty easily, but that's minor and easily handled. Love them!"

They fit spot on, they have lots of cushion for walking and they look retro KOOL and take you back to the day of shoulder pads and ratted high hair.

My toes swell at the end of the day and necessitates the wider toe box of the wide version. The widest part of my feet are such that medial side is more distal than the lateral side, which makes finding a sole that aligns difficult, but in these, it matches or is more forgiving. The surprise for me, though, is the memory foam: I used to be skeptical about the praises of memory foam from my friends, but I am now converted! The match of these shoes have saved my feet. The material is easy to dirty, but easy to clean. It holds in 20-degree walks between public transit and home, with or without snow. I have been complimented for its height and classic look, and it raises me to 5\u2019 tall, to boot. So many perks for such a great price!"

I am always a size 8 and bought a size 8. My foot is average to slightly wide. When I first put my feet in the shoes, they were slightly snug, yes. *But I knew they just needed to be broke in. After two days of wear they have literally melded to my foot perfectly and I'm so happy I didn't half size up.* I was excited to write this review for active workers like teachers and nurses. I'm an active worker all day and a heavy walker. I am basically on my feet most of the day. I've had heel pain, foot pain and calf pain for years, not being able to find the right shoe. This is literally the best shoe I've ever worn. I can be on my feet all day at work and then walk to do errands after a long day and not feel a thing. This shoe has actually made me more active because I don't have the dreaded pain anymore. They are SO comfortable. I am very thankful to have found them. Added bonus: much more stylish and cute in person. I thought they might be a little bulky and matronly in person but they are adorable. I couldn't be happier."

It\u2019s not the wrong size, it\u2019s just my heel somehow slides up when I walk\u2026 it\u2019s the only thing that makes them uncomfortable."

I normally wear a size 7, so I ordered that size, but they were bulky and too loose causing my heels to slip. So I ordered a 6.5 and they were still slipping. I ended up ordering from Reebok's website directly and purchased an entirely different shoe style. I am much happier with the quality and fit."

    "message": "im a size 9. I can get away with a 9.5 if I love the shoe and a 9 isn't available. I ordered the 9.5 wide. I have less than a 1/4 inch from the big toe to the end of the shoe. The wide isn't really wide either and are quite tight. If you have a naturally wide foot then these are not the shoe for you. They are not 100 percent leather either as stated in the description of the shoe. Only the part where the Reebox logo is actual leather. the rest is man made. The memory foam is nice but poorly attached inside the shoe and not properly lined up inside the shoe. I,m a waitress and spend more than 8 hours on my feet. I just received the shoes yesterday and have only worn them around the house so I cannot say how my feet will feel after my first few shifts. As of now my feet feel ok in them but a little restricted in the width and they do slip a bit in the back when I walk. I recommend if buying this shoe go at least a half size up for a little more room. If u go a whole size up they will surely slip when you walk. Id also recommend ordering the wide width regardless because the normal width would be quite tight on any foot since the wide width is currently tight on me. Perhaps after I break them in that will change. Ill update my review after a week or so of trying them at work. Hope this helps."

    "message": "I ordered these shoes for nursing school because they meet all requirements (white, leather, no mesh or holes). However, I definitely should have paid attention to the majority of reviews and ordered a bigger size. I not only had to order an entire size up than I normally wear, but I also had to order them in wide which I have NEVER had to do. That being said, once you get the size that fits you perfectly, they are great! They look really nice and they're very sturdy feeling and comfortable. You can tell they're made well and will last me a long time. Shout out to Amazon for the quick exchange before they even received my original pair back! That's awesome customer service."

I will say though that the back by the heel is weirdly flatter than before so it took a few days wear to get used to stepping different, but all in all I still give 5 stars! 10/10 Definitely recommend!"

The width was actually great but it didn't help the length. My foot was coming out of them when I walked and uncomfortable. I would suggest if you need a wide, size down half a size or if you teeter on the line, get the half size smaller."

I really like the way these look, but after getting them and tried them on I was disappointed to find the arch support is nearly void. If you have flat feet or a low arch they would be fine, but for someone with a normal or high arch support they won't feel good."

I've been having a problem finding wide enough shoes for my feet and when I ordered the wide in these I don't feel like my feet are hanging off too bad! The cushion is great like everyone said they were. Also the item came in about 3 days after I placed my order. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and I am so happy I decided to give these a try! The last shoe I ordered were women's Espirit sneakers and they were not wide enough for my feet. Also, I am normally a size 7 but I decided to order a size larger like everyone has suggested and it is the perfect fit! :) Really happy to finally have a black sneaker to wear while I am in Europe that is comfortable and nice looking! Edit*** Although these are nice looking shoes they arent leather so they never fully broke in like I had hoped. I have extremely flat feet and I should have left my insoles in but because the padding on the inside could not be removed, I found it hard to wear them with my insoles. Really a true bummer."
