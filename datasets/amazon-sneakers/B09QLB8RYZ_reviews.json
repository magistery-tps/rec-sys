They're pretty stiff right out of the box. I wore them for about an hour for the first time to run errands and ended up with horribly clawed up, bleeding sores on my achilles tendon that took a couple of weeks to heal. In fairness, I wore them without socks so that's on me but the back of the heels on these shoes come up higher, are super stiff, and are going to take some wear to get them to be comfortably malleable. I have other leather sneakers of the same style that didn't have the same break-in pain. So buyer beware. I currently have them on for a second wearing, protected with cushier socks to see if that helps with the rubbing. I don't find the cloudfoam insole to be any cushier than other non-athletic sneakers that I have. Other than that, they're as expected. They look good. Decent quality for the price."

The heel took a little breaking in, it gave me blisters on the back of my ankle, so I would wear long socks and blister bandages the first few times to prevent rubbing. I found on the third wear they were much better and now they are my go-to shoes!"

I have a bad ankle from two sprains and a broken foot over the years. These shoes are very comfortable and  support my ankle. I haven\u2019t had any issues with the backs rubbing my ankles, but I\u2019m wearing low athletic socks with high back tabs (also Adidas). I also love that these are really easy to keep clean, and also easy to clean off if they do get a little mark on them. Great buy."

The adidas logo matches the real one with side by side comparisons, I have another pair of shoes I bought from a physical adidas store. Quality stitches, and the tags with different serial number, etc. I got the White/Silver Metallic/Silver Metallic color, the holographic looking one. It's very cute, absolutely loved the design. BUT The material it's made of is super stiff. The collar is a bit too high, and if I wear my shoes tight like I do with running shoes, it rubs against the heels and make it blister/bleed. So I always have to wear it kind of loose. Because how stiff the material is, the section between your toes and the top of your feet, where it normally bends as you walk, the shoe presses down on it and it's very painful. I am a college student, so I walk about 1-2miles to classes and back everyday. I wore it at least 3 times a week since Sep. 2021, it's now Feb 2021. The materials have soften a bit, but still never completely \"broken in\". The part where it bends is still stiff and painful if walking a long distance. Definitely worth it for a girl's day out kind of shoe. But not for everyday or long distance walking."

My right shoe isn\u2019t going to last as long as the left simply because of this defect :(.

I'm a huge fan of Adidas in general, but their cost has gone up more than I'm willing to spend on them, so I was very pleased to find this on sale.  If you don't mind paying crazy prices for sneakers, these are a good buy for what you get anyway."

    "message": "I\u2019m a true 10, ordered these in a 10 and they were too big. I immediately sent them back and ordered a 9.5. At first I thought they were fine so I wore them to go out. But they are also too big and rub the back of my heel because I can\u2019t tie them tightly enough.  I\u2019ve already worn them several times because they\u2019re cute and it was too late to return them, but I wish I would have ordered a 9. My advice, be prepared to possibly order two half sizes down, depending on your foot.  I don\u2019t know if these are sized for men by mistake? Other than the length issue, they really are super comfy through the footbed, roomy in the toe, are easy to slip on and off which is great for airport travel - overall I\u2019m happy with them. Next time I\u2019ll size down again, though."

Notably, I have had to wear taller socks with these because I immediately sensed that the backs would rub against/cut my ankles if I wore crew cut socks with them. This is the only reason I give them 4/5 stars for comfort; hopefully with continued wear this won't be an issue. Great sneakers, fashionable enough to wear with dresses and skirts, too."
