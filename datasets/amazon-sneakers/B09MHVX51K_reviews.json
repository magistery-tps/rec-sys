Its in both of my heels and it hurts to walk long distances. I've tried a few different kinds of shoes and these are the best. Do my heels still hurt, yea its not a miracle. Its a dang shoe. But...the shoes don't make it worse and it actually helps because of the way the blades on the bottom compress and take most of the strain. Hard to explain, but i'm going to get these in every color."
