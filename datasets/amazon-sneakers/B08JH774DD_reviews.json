I decided to look on Amazon for shoes so I could get the shoes fast and I ran across these shoes.  The price was affordable and reading the reviews I chose these shoes.  The next day after getting the shoes I went on a walk to break them in and they worked.  My feet felt great.  They still are in one piece and I can't find a complaint about these shoes.  Will definitely be getting another pair when the time comes.  I will be recommending these shoes to people and family."

As of last month, the back spring instead of the shoes had popped out and made it extremely uncomfortable to wear. I did try ways to fix it, but there weren't many options at that point. I did have to throw them out, but they were great while they lasted."

They are ok.  Not the best for walking, but comfortable enough. Pros are...fit true to size, upper shoe material is decent breathable fabric, look ok if you don't care about brand name, deep jet black color has not faded with use.  Cons are...no support as normal brand name shoe in same price range $50-$60, therefore not good for long walks, definitely NOT a running shoe."

And they have lasted very well (no ripping at the sides of the toes like some cheap shoes do). I liked these so much, I ordered what I thought was the same brand. They looked almost identical to these. I wish I could rate those, but Amazon has blocked reviews.  I say this so if you decide to order, look at the name. THESE are comfortable shpes and fit well for a less expensive shoe. The 1s that look similar are HORRIBLE! Overall I'm extremely happy I tried these and am here to order another pair."
