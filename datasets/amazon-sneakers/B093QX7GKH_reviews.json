I have unusual feet, in that one foot is a full size larger than the other, but even buying shoes that fit my larger foot, both feet are quite comfortable in these. They are neither too small nor too big. They offer adequate support, although I may add some sort of insole for better arch support. Not everyone would need that, but it might make them more comfortable for me."

It is much lighter than I had anticipated so, I can walk and stand at work all day.  My other shoes are clunky and rather stiff. Con: I am finding small spots on the toe (even though I treat my shoes as gold) that are losing their \"white\".

The only drawback is the stitching at the base of the tongue looks weird and I wonder if they start to separate there only time will tell. Otherwise I\u2019d recommend them.

    "message": "Only wore these shoes 5 times. Here are my thoughts so far. Pros: *Light and portable. *These are off white. Pure white can be overpowering bright and glaring. Ever try to dirty your brand new white sneakers a little before wearing them? These goes with everything the same way. *Minimal, simple and elegant design. *Very comfortable cushion for my feet. *Feels resistant to getting dirty compared to my other white sneakers. Have not wiped them at all and they still look clean. Cons: *Big deal here. I used long to low cut thicker socks (standard low cut that show a bit) during my initial wears and had no issues. One day, I used thin low cut socks to work and the minute I stepped out of my vehicle, it dug into my Achilles badly. I barely could walk a few feet and was in total agony from the parking lot to my office. Luckily, I brought extra heel pads out of caution from other reviews. I was pretty doubtful of those at first. The heel pads do help, but a little bothersome. This is a let down given the price. *A big concern is the durability of the leather. It is light and soft, but crease very easily and awkwardly around the shoe. I was walking and staring at them at first, but decided to stop being a maniac. It is less visible to see creasing with the white color. Think carefully getting a darker color. Use a shoe tree or stuff them to maintain its shape. That seems to help. I tried a half size down, but it was a bit too tight and snug. I got my true size and noticed the length did not differ substantially, but it was a little wider and a lot more comfortable for my feet. Perhaps size down if you are between half sizes. I rate them 3.5."

    "message": "These basic white sneakers were exactly what I wanted. Light weight and quality materials. In this review I'll cover three things that I think are notable. Fit, quality and comfort. I normally wear 11M (US) for dress shoes and for casual shoes. But often for athletic shoes, I have to size up, particularly for brands like Nike and Adidas. I wasn't sure about what size I should with these since I have other casual style Cole Haan in 11M that fit fine, but these are an athletic style. So I went with my normal size, and they fit great. I am also impressed with the quality of the shoes. The leather has a soft feel, but the shoe itself has a solid structure (not floppy). Though a very plain style, the stitching and workmanship makes it appear very high quality. Also, the color is not bright white, but rather it has a very slight gray hue so it appears muted, which is gives it a premium look. Lastly, these are very comfortable. They are light weight and provide reasonable support for casual wear, though not for actual sporting activity. The arch support is less than average (ie. flatter). I am very happy with this purchase. Though there are a number of options for basic white leather sneakers, I personally chose these base a lot on my satisfaction with previous Cole Haan purchases. These did not disappoint."

Their coloring is more of an off-white vs. pure white, but that's a good thing so they don't blind you.  Some people have written reviews complaining about the heel area of the shoe being ultra stiff and tearing into their Achilles.  That never happened to me. I've always worn these with crew or dress socks, so maybe that helps prevent it. I've worn my pair at least 20 times now and they're holding up.  No horribly deep creases in the uppers and no peeling or anything (my pics were taken today).  They're easy to clean; a wet paper towel does the job.  The shoes are pretty comfortable.  They have just enough cushioning (I have bony feet) to not hurt.  Where the shoes are lacking is support.  After a day of wearing them my feet sometimes feel sore.  I have low arches, and end up with tender feet if I wear them for an 8-10 hour period or walk a lot in them. I like the look of these shoes a lot so I'll keep wearing them, but not if I'm going to walk a lot.  Inserts will probably help."

These are lighter than a few of the other shoes I have of this style. I put them on immediately (thanks to Amazon fulfillment for such a fast shipping...I ordered these less than 20 hours prior to receiving)...and they feel amazing on the first try on. Other brands of basic casual tennis shoes I enjoy Vans 5 eyelet Basic black with white sole (I include an insole insert with these as my feet are slightly more narrow than their fit) Jousen Leather business Casual Ecco Soft 7 (possibly my favorite for business casual wear, but these take a few uses before breaking in nicely) Sperry (my favorites 5 eyelet for basic casual with shorts) Sketchers with memory foam insoles (Mark Nasen) I have worn Cole Haan Dress Shoes for years and loved their comfort and durability. I look forward to wearing these more in the weeks to come as part of my regular business casual rotation."
