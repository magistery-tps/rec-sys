I am going to order more of these Athletic Shoes. The shoes help with taking pressure of my knees, which makes so I can walk longer and farther distance. So yes, these are a 5 star for me."

They felt a little stiff when I put them on but over the course of an hour of wearing them, they completely relaxed and I didn\u2019t want to take them off. They are extremely light, yet supportive.

The styrofoam toe inserts had completely disintegrated inside both shoes and it was quite a task to clean out those tiny clingy styrofoam chards. One of the shoes was delivered with dirt on the soul and side.  Clearly they\u2019d been returned by a previous purchaser and weren\u2019t cleaned before repackaging.

I work in a hospital and am always running around, these sneakers have not even begun to wear out yet. The laces work great and do not come undone easily as other cheap laces do. My only real gripe about these sneakers is the complete lack of comfort. They have zero cushion in them ands don't provide any arch support whatsoever. That said, a pair of Dr. Shoals inserts took care of most of that problem. What's the best here is the price. They are extremely affordable if you're like me and want to get multiple pairs in different colors to match scrubs!"

Hubby put on, great fit, wide enough in the toe box to give him a fantastic fit and they have good arch support. I'm happy the the fit was perfect for him. He decided after about 2 weeks of wearing the shoes that he wanted another pair in a different color."
