However, the top is firmer than that, and I need to pull & stick fingers in behind my heels and it's almost as hard as the canvas shoes I have with elastic over the top.  For them, I need a shoe horn.  They are also not socks all the way through.  The bottom is a regular bottom with a thin layer of something resembling the exterior glued on top of a liner that can slip out.  It was also a little bumpy and made the bottom of my feet sweaty.  I may have to wear thin socks with these.  On the other hand I like their looks & they are comfortable enough, and a tad easier to pull on than the canvas slipons which have an elastic top. I'm keeping them for those reasons."

When these shoes arrived and I tried them on, I couldn't believe how good they felt and how I could run in them without hurting my feet. They are super cute and versatile. In fact, I'm wearing them right now!"

After 6 months of wearing them to work, they are still holding shape and very comfortable. I had ankle pain for 18 months since I fell and I think these shoes helped with support. There was no need to break the shoes either. AND they do not slip either. I wouldn't call them 100 percent slip proof- stepping on cucumber on the floor in the kitchen, they will slip but  wet floor is not really a problem. I just came back to buy more."

The no-laces helps when she may be running late, and even when time is not an issue the no-laces is very convenient. The craftmanship is very good quality, and the comfort is deservedly renowed for all Nike \"Air\" foot wear. Bonus is my wife had never bothered with a pair and so had not a good idea of the VAST improvement in comfort she was about to experience, as well as deserve! To see her happy and then hear how her feet didn't hurt her that day she got home while wearing these for the first time- PRICELESS. And the fact she received MANY compliments all day long- told me immediately, on \"top\" of her initial joy and happiness when I surprised her with them and she took them out off the box, to the fact that when there's any compliment- \"much less\" MANY COMPLIMENTS DURING HER DAY!- That these shoes made her very happy as well as her beautiful little feetsers! For me; I'm happy I know my wife and ended up selecting the perfect style AND color shoe- that I definately give the \"all systems go\" to Nike for this model and color \"Air\" shoe. 2. - The size was a \"little\" issue however, as in the description of the shoe, it's Amazon's BIG MISTAKE. AND HERE'S WHY PLUS THE SIMPLE SOLUTION; So pictures of the shoe and a description is good, but simply stating sizes ACTUALLY MEANS ONLY HALF OF THE INFORMATION EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ IN ORDER TO CHOOSE THE CORRECT SIZE!!!! Saying, for example, sizes from say 5 to 9 in 5.5,6,6.5,7 etc is NOT ENOUGH TO BUY THE CORRECT SIZE!!! Those numbers are next to meaningless if there is not a standard to reference the sizes with!!! That's HUGE when buying ANY CLOTHING!!! Companies can give whatever the hell number size to a shoe but the fact is that series of shoes run \"big\" or run \"small\" and saying that is also not enough either! As any intelligent person knows. So it's a guessing game- which can be completely avoided by 1 or 2 easy pics of the shoe WITH A TAPE MEASURE OR RULER NEXT TO IT SO WE CAN SEE THE EXACT DIMENSIONS OF LENGTH AND WIDENESS TO COMPARE WITH WHATEVER NUMBER THEY ASSOCIATE THAT SHOE WITH!!!! IN MY CASE THEY ARE SLIGHTLY TOO BIG!!!!!- and thank God I bought another DIFFERENT pair and got the size EXACTLY CORRECT. There's, IMO, no excuse at all for companies to hire some \"hair-brained\" dufus to come up with the graphics to advertise on the site, and on this case it's SHOES, and not to include in the advertisement graphics the extremely important info in a way that the consumer can easily see and understand!; therefore making the purchasing experience GREAT and no anxiety over if the size is going to be slightly off or not! That's completely unnecessary and definately RUINS a lot of surprises that otherwise would be perfect- THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE AS THE CUSTOMER IS PAYING HARD EARNED MONEY FOR THE PRODUCT!!!!! Again; a picture with a ruler adjacent to the shoe length AND width is PARAMOUNT for any and every shoe!!! Its common sense people! 1- Great shoe. 2- Idiot-level intellect not showing the TRUE SIZE next to the shoes themselves."

    "message": "I love that they are so lightweight. I love that they are super comfortable after they are on my feet. I don't love their lack of arch support, but there's room in them to fit my custom arch inserts into them & still maintain good comfort. I hate that they are sooo hard to get onto my feet due to the sock-like material. Those of us with high arches know that shoes with a long top lip like these are often tight over that top arch bone. These are not tight, but after I finally get the front part of my high arch foot in them, the heel material has flattened, making it necessary to dig under (already broke a fingernail) and grap the heal fabric to pull it back up.  There is a back-loop but it is just too small and flimsy to grab onto easily.  An old shoe horn I found in my closet has become essential for these.  Even with the help of the shoe horn, though, these are exasperating to try to put on over a high top arch.  Most of us are accustomed to quickly put on our shoes quickly with one hand while we're standing up; that won't be happening with these shoes. O These are like trying to put on a sock (which takes two hands) but worse because this particular sock has a big bulky heal attached to it. Ugh!  It's not fun having to sit down and struggle to put them on every time, so I hesitate to recommend these. They are definitely not slip-ons. Update: after having these for a year and wearing them for walking on the sidewalk 4x a week on average, I continue to love and hate them - for different reasons. First, I'm disappointed in the quality. After a year of almost daily wear, the left sole has cracked so if i step in water, I get a wet left foot. Except for the cracked sole, they still look and feel new. Second, I'm happy with the way they've stretched and become comfortable, though it took a month of daily wear. Considering how difficult it has been to find a comfortable walking shoe, I've concluded these have more pros than cons. I don't like having to use a shoe horn to out them on, but they do look nice and they've worked well for my daily walks this past year."

    "message": "I gave this product 5 stars, not for its stylish look, but for its super comfortable wearing. My feet are very picky on shoes; one foot has bunion pain when walking and they tend to sweat all the time and need air circulation between toes. In the past, I wore sandals or open toe shoes all year around until this cold winter year. I can not wear stylish boots or brand tennis shoes because of my sweat feet. So, as I researched and found this shoes. Even though the product description says, \"Lady Girls Modern Jazz Dance Easy Shoe\", I am not a Jazz dancer, but I like the shoe's height and arching look. So, I decided to give it try. After I received it I wore it and I realized I made a good choice. Again, my 5 stars are not for its stylish look. The followings are my 5 stars' reasons: 1. Super comfortable for walking; it is very light; I can easily speed walk with this shoes. 2. it has some arching support that my bunion toe does not give me pain feeling while working. 3. its fabric allows my feet to breath through, so my sweaty feet would not make the shoes wet any more. 4. it is easy to slip on and off; no worry about tie up shoes. 5. it has a medium level high heel shoe effect and higher shoe base that make you feel a little taller and you can walk on raining or muddy road in city street without getting your shoes wet."

They are bouncy and comfy, but just don\u2019t plan on walking jogging etc.. Bc they don\u2019t support, like you could turn your ankle.  I do wish they had more support and since they are for fashion, I would say to the makers,, they are kool, make some silver, gold, hologram, like UK trainers ! ... tighten them up, then send me a 9 to review.. \ud83e\udd23I\u2019m serious !all in all I love them, just don\u2019t use them to exercise but very unique feeling to wear, really like what you want to walk on.

Thank you fir passing this along to seller I A\u2019m writing this review on the second pair I\u2019ve ordered... I got the purple in a 9, they are much bigger than my Navy 9 that I got first. The shoe is so loose ( the top material is the problem, not the sole). They are comfy if you just stand, but the first day I wore these I fell and twisted my ankle. My complaint is I\u2019m trying to work with the company, informing them that they have a good thing, just is inconsistent. As for Amazon, they say they are not responsible, but also will not pass complaint to seller. A dozen e-mails on tracking the package, but zero reply on why one size 9 fits and one says 39.5 and does not.i think they sent me the wrong size and this is my second pair. I feel they should replace them."

Bought them for walking but love them so much I have been using them for work.  Only drawback is the inside sole comes out when pulling them off.  Will definitely buy again."

I tried them on and thought oh ok...these are comfortable so I'll keep them.  I ended up wearing them out to a concert the next night with a cute dress and it was then that i fell in love.  The comfort and support they gave while standing at the concert the whole time was amazing.  Felt like i was on clouds. a few days later I took them with me to a conference and would switch into them after wearing heels all day.  I am so not a sneaker person but these......these are everything i didn't know I needed."

If anything they are some of the most slippery feeling shoe bottoms I've ever felt. I would not trust to wear these shoes on wet ground, in the snow, smooth concrete, or waxed floors. Even on rough concrete I would feel nervous to wear these. It's a shame, because these shoes would have been perfect if the bottoms were durable rubber like most sneakers. I'll still keep them, just better bring an arm to hold onto just in case lol"
