Inexpensive and my husband says they look nice on me. At first I was skeptical about the accent color. I rock these eith just about any casual outfit."

Very soft and comfortable inside and the grip is decent. The toes aren't stiff and allowed me to move with ease from burpees, to jump rope and lifting. I've only used them a week and I'm very happy with this purchase."

I bought these to wear at Youth Camp doing kitchen duty on concrete flooring for more than 12-hour days. By day two my feet hurt like crazy. So I switched between these tennis shoes and another pair for half of each day starting on day 3. That worked much better for my feet. Otherwise, these are very comfortable and nice-looking shoes."

They may be cheaper then the name brand sneakers but my feet don't hurt when I wear them. I love the way these feel so much on my feet that I just purchased a second pair in black because my name brand black sneakers are hurting my feet plus I have to wear black shoes to work and the cost for the pair isn't gonna break my budget."

I bought them in the winter of 2021 and they are now just getting a small a hole by the toe, however for twenty something dollars they will give you your moneys worth! I would 10/10 buy again :)"

Also, I have feet that are like 9 3/4's and with this walking they start out at say 9 1/2 but after a few days or a nice meal or even a king tide my feet will swell add in thick or thin socks I am wearing and you see why I get a size 10 or 9.5 Wide.

They have held up well and don't seem to fall apart. They are comfortable to wear and don't cause issues and are extremely lightweight. I do frequently wear them out also just to run to the store and whatnot. I am someone with narrow feet and a small frame and wear a shoe insert in all my shoes [from higher-end running shoes to dress shoes to these] for heel strike and arch support and have had no issues putting one in these. I would suspect, given the nature of what these are made out of, that if one was frequently on rough, hard surfaces, these shoes would wear out much more quickly or if there was frequent friction with the sides. As for me, I'm happy there's a cheap option that comfortable, works well, holds up [most wear occurring indoors] and is cheap. Ordering more."
