Second pair fit better but the heal started to look like a marshmallow that has been squeezed after wearing a total of 8 hours. I am 120 pounds and was disappointed that happened so fast. I can't imagine what the heel would have done in 3 months. Had to return yet again\ud83d\ude0f I'm going for a 3rd time in hopes that last pair was just a fluke of some kind. Anyone else experience that before I try one last time? I didn't see one other review with same experience.....ALSO the price just dropped on Sorells website 10 dollars cheaper than here on Amazon!"

Very flexible sole which is perfect for moving about a bar since I\u2019m practically running everywhere. My feet do t get sore when I\u2019m standing around either.  They do come pretty narrow but it feels more like a \u201csock\u201d fit if that makes sense."

I\u2019ve had them three days now and I\u2019ve worn them to walk every day. Twice a day yesterday. I think these are probably the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned. Not only when I\u2019m wearing them, but I have NO foot pain when I take them off. Or the next morning - I can\u2019t wait to put them back on my feet. I\u2019ll be 65 soon and my feet hurt when I wake up each day. Especially if I\u2019ve been for a walk the day before, but not after I walk in these. I usually wear a 7 1/2 (sometimes 8) in athletic shoes and I got a size 7 in these. They fit perfectly. I wear thin no-show socks (like really no-show - like you\u2019d wear with street shoes) because I can\u2019t bring myself to wear them without socks. You could though - they\u2019re that comfortable. I too worry about about the laces going under the shoe. I\u2019ll just try to avoid puddles and mud - the shoelaces do go up in the \u201cwaves\u201d of the bottom of the shoe quite a bit so, for the most part, it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Worse case, I can wash the laces. I know everyone\u2019s feet are different, but I can\u2019t recommend these shoes enough. I\u2019m already looking at other colors! (And the laceless ones - wonder if they\u2019d be as comfortable?) Get these shoes!"

I can only walk in them for 1-2 hours before my feet hurt sooo bad. The top of the shoes and seam is so tight that it hurts to walk and it leaves red marks/indents on the top of my foot. I now have blisters on the top, and back of my feet from these shoes. I am DYING to get out of them by the end of the day. I am so so sad about this because this is NOT how someone should feel in expensive tennis shoes. I am so displeased and wish I could get a refund. I cannot \u201cbreak in\u201d the shoes because there is no stretch to them. Also.. I cannot even wear normal socks, I have to wear half socks that slip down because the shoes are so low on your feet. I would not recommend at all because they hurt so bad and get dirty/creased at the bottom fast too\u2026 not to mention how my foot does not feel supported in the middle since there is no bottom part of the shoe there. \ud83d\ude22"

There\u2019s just something about the cut where the ankles are that just didn\u2019t do it for me, plus they\u2019re like wearing a sock. I should also mention that when I put them on, my feet almost instantly fell asleep in them.  (I have narrow boney feet)- it was weird.  So, before I shipped them back, I asked my teenage daughter to try them on..she loved the looks of them too. I got the same underwhelmed reaction out of her as soon as she turned to look at the side profile. She also commented that her feet were tingly and falling asleep almost instantly.  For the price, I just couldn\u2019t justify keeping them. I\u2019m a person that stands on their feet all day for work, and was hoping they\u2019d be a stylish addition to looking good, and also being comfortable....it was a hard pass, which was sad because I own a bunch of Sorels."

    "message": "I purchased these shoes for the long hours on my feet. (Nurse) Ive tried breaking these in, in hopes that they would become more comfortable. The toe box is narrow, the heel has no cushion or support, they are so incredible uncomfortable. Clearly I was expecting more especially for the price . I have several Sorel tennis shoes. These are horrible. They easily smudge which you can clearly see in the picture, another reason I will not be wearing these for work. A sad Sorel purchase indeed."

    "message": "Now a month in so here are my take aways.  I like the shock absorption of these sneakers.  As far as the fit, I found when I wear socks they don't feel supportive, my feet slide around and forward, the mesh upper is stretchy.  So, I wore them without socks which did give me more of a supportive feel and my feet didn't slide.  The downfall .. 3 blisters after a 2 mile walk. The insert has good arch support but I am struggling with the sliding issue.  Not sure on the value, these weren't cheap to be on the fence."

Long time devotee to their boots, these have increased my love of the brand. It\u2019s like walking on air!  Light, comfy, springy. They do come untied easily, but again, not enough nuisance for me to ding them."

When it arrived, it already looked like the sole was coming off. I\u2019m hoping the return them and get a better pair. The shoes itself is comfortable and light weight and that\u2019s why it got 2 stars."
