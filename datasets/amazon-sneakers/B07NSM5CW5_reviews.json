Toe box just right and I really like the pads where the ball of the foot hit. Need more arch support.  For some reason most shoe manufactures think wide feet have no arch. Mine are quite high.  I have wide feet with bunions.  These shoes are great for getting chores done and they are nice enough for wearing around town."

Size worked out great. definitely would buy again. The only down side was the condition of the box when delivered. The shoe box was totally crushed, but it didn't hurt the shoes."
