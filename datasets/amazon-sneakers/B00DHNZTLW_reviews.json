They fit ok at first, but after a while on my feet, I felt my toes and top of my feet near the 5t proximal phalynx bones.  Also, I developed a blister on my foot and had to remove my shoes.  I returned them the next day and will update you on the fit of the larger size."

    "message": "(Short version: these shoes work well for long  shifts in a slower fast food place, although may be a lil tight.) My old shoes had finally given up after a couple months of gluing and re-gluing them, to my coworkers horror. They convinced me to buy a new pair, so I scoured online until finding these; they seemed to be adequate. I order them, and reglue my old shoes one last time to use while waiting for these to arrive. They finally arrived before work one day, and I was excited to wear them that night. I tried them on prior to leaving. They were a little tighter than expected, but otherwise not a bad fit--a miracle, considering I have quite large feet. I show up to work and of course my coworkers notice immediately I have new, non-ragedy shoes. I don't have much to say about the appearance of these, as I don't think it really matters. They're shoes for doing a job. Which, they do a fine job of. I have yet to slip and fall in my work place aside from places where the shoes don't matter (ie. some genius decides to leave a huge grease spill in the middle of the floor without informing anyone, or someone spills a bunch of fries and decides not to clean them up.) It is important to note, however, that while I have used these shoes for 30+ hour work weeks for months without any slipping issues, I also work at a low-volume store where we try to keep the floor as non-slippery as possible. If you work at a grease soaked McDonald's, you may form a different opinion of these shoes than I have. All in all, these shoes have worked well for my specific needs, and I will probably buy another pair in the same size whenever I wear my current ones out"

    "message": "I calculate I've spent about 576 hours in these shoes, spread out over an 8-month period. I wash cars, so these shoes have spent time in a wash bay on smooth concrete, as well as outside on a parking lot. They are extremely comfortable and have good traction in a wet environment.  However they are wearing out faster than I would normally expect; starting to tear at the seams on the upper, and the tread is wearing on the heel and ball.  BUT they are priced right, and easy to replace at this price. They are not waterproof, but resist splashing better than mesh-type running shoes. I would buy them again for the comfort alone. I do recommend a cushioned insole, as the included one wears out fairly quickly."

    "message": "I have wide feet. Not that it\u2019s a bad thing, but I find it can make it hard to find shoes that fit. I ordered these in Women\u2019s 8.5 Wide. First try on, my heart sank, they felt really tight through the toe area. I squashed my fear, wore them with thinner socks for a 6 hour shift in the kitchen & they are WONDERFUL! My feet, ankles and legs did NOT hurt. I compare the comfort level to my work Skechers and these really do work. I love the sole, no slipping or sliding on the floor. I also like that these are available in \u201cpure\u201d white and I will be ordering a black pair soon! They seemed to help stabilize my ankles, without being high tops. No rubbing, the heel stays put, they could stand a bit more arch support, but that\u2019s not a deal breaker for me! I would recommend to my friends!"

    "message": "I like these shoes because they are slip resistant. I wear them outside when it has rained or is raining. They are very heavy so I don't wear them often. Also, when I wear ankle socks, water from the street when I'm walking in the rain often splashes up on my ankles because these shoes do not cover my ankles."
