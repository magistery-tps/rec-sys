So if you have wider feet these would probably work. They aren't super cushioned so I filled the extra space with a gel cushion to improve them. I like them very much now. They look to be well made and I expect they will last through the winter and am so happy to have found a winter sneaker at an affordable price, which is half the price of most I've seen."

I walked around  Edinburgh in Scotland for two days (cobblestone streets and all) days without so much as a hint of a blister or discomfort.  The first day, we walked for about 5 miles.  I would totally recommend these as being very comfortabl for walking.  I boght the black suede and waterproofed them before this trip.  I wish I could get them in grey sued too."

Yeah, these Keds are to me what those boots were to Monica. They\u2019re so cute and they go with everything, but dear lord are they painful! I\u2019ve had them for a month and have worn them every 2-3 days, thinking I\u2019d eventually break them in or develop the callouses to make them tolerable. Oh how wrong I have been. I didn\u2019t realize it was possible for blisters to develop on top of each other, but my pinky toes show that it indeed is. My heels have open wounds that hurt when I put on socks. I have tried toe covers for blister prevention. I have put inserts along the backs of the shoes that\u2019s supposed to keep my heels from rubbing up against the shoe. I have tried thick socks. I have tried baby powder. Literally every tool one can use to protect their feet, I have tried. Thank god for blister seal bandaids! I live in a city where people walk everywhere, and I have - on more than 1 occasion - had to take a taxi home b/c I couldn\u2019t walk any further in the shoes. I wasn\u2019t going to write a review, but this morning I was wearing the Keds while walking my dog to doggy daycare and suddenly felt a tremendous pain on my foot and noticed that a surprise blister (aka blisters I didn\u2019t know I had formed) on my heel had started bleeding. It\u2019s really difficult to get a cab when you have a dog, and Uber Pet rides are ridiculously expensive. So in order to make it the rest of the way to his doggy daycare, I had to hobble my way to the closest CVS and buy more bandaids. (Side note: shout out to the workers at CVS who let me bring my dog inside). It was while I was in the checkout line with my bloody, throbbing foot that I realized I should probably warn other people about this. Now like I said, these Keds are super cute and go with any outfit. Are they also excruciatingly painful? Yes. Have they ripped my feet apart? Also yes. But am I going to keep wearing them when my outfit calls for them? Yes. But only when walking short distances or am with someone who I can get a piggyback me everywhere, and I\u2019ll make sure to bring a backup pair of flip flops and a stash of bandaids."

Of course they are no New Balances but they have more padding than like a plain Converse canvas shoe. I usually get blisters on my heels in new shoes but haven't had any issues with these which is great. They do run slightly large as other reviewers are saying but not much. I'm usually a 9 or 9.5. Got a 9 in these and they fit on the roomier side. I'm deducting a point because the laces are barely long enough to tie them and the shoes also make a bit of a plopping sound with every step. Maybe it's because they're a little large but it hasn't gone away after a few weeks of wearing them."
