I replaced the inner sole with an arch support sole and absolutely love these, but they were finally wearing out and I wanted the exact same shoe. I bought a brand new pair and it seems the manufacturer has narrowed the toe box slightly (had to send the first shipment back because it was way too narrow, but Amazon sent a replacement immediately). I generally wear a 7.5 but in this shoe I need 8.5 and I usually need a Wide, but in this case the Regular was fine except the new ones are a little snug in the toe box. The uppers are leather and will stretch a bit and so will only get more comfortable as I wear them. I wish the new ones were a little bit roomier in the toe box, but I'm very happy with them and the price was exceptionally good at 35 dollars. They are comfortable on the first wearing and I expect they'll get better over time."

My older pair feels like it is made of a leather type material as opposed to this newer pair that feels more vinyl, but that's a sign of the times.  I still like them.  They cushion your feet very nicely.  No need to break them in and the heel is padded."

I think the original shoes were leather, these are definitely synthetic. I doubt they'll hold up as long or as well. The features section asks about the toe box - it's too long and narrow though this is the same size I've always purchased. This brand has chosen a different manufacturer for their shoes and allowed significant changes, I guess for profit."

Being made of good leather, they hold the foot snugly while allowing expansion as you need it.
