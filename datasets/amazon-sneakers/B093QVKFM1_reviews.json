I typically wear a 7.5-8 in most shoes, but got these in an 8...they were a little bigger than expected, but still comfortable.  After walking close to 20 miles in these kver the course of my trip, I did develop blisters in the bottom of my feet near my toes....but I attribute that to me being out of shape, and them fitting slightly large.  Overall they were very comfortable.  I wore them casual and dressed up.  Get 'em!"

I am traveling to Scotland where rain is always a threat. I did not want to pack more shoes, so I ordered these to wear with a black pants and sweater outfit for a reception.  Most of my clothes are black. These shoes are good looking, but I've been warned that Naturalizer shoes are uncomfortable by my daughter who had 2 pairs. She said they were miserably uncomfortable. I hope that's not true because this trip is 20 days long."

I don't have wide feet, but I have to wear a wide shoe because of foot problems. It's so hard to find something that's both stylish and comfortable; usually your'e sacrificing one or the other. These shoes check both boxes! And they actually have a little bit of arch support, too. I haven't worn them except for an hour or two here and there so I can't speak to all day wear like at Disney World or something but overall, I would highly recommend them."

I normally wear 81/2 wide and it is a good fit but you never know with sneakers and thicker socks. In the past I have had to get a 9 wide in tennis shoes.

I could\u2019ve bought a size bigger but then, I\u2019d guess, they would be too long. It\u2019s a shame because I really like the look. DEFINITELY not for wide feet. If you have normal width feet and you just gotta have these, go up a half size (at least). Trust me."

Wish it was slightly deeper for a more comfy fit - I get that it\u2019s low profile but it\u2019s just slightly to the point where I feel like my heel/ankle aren\u2019t snuggly in the shoe. For reference, I have a high arch and narrow to average width feet. My toes are on the longer side but feel like I have plenty of wiggle room. Appearance: I got the white with tan banding. It looks sharp - bright white and the leather material looks more expensive up close. Pairs well with ankle jeans. Minor note - the first time I wore them my partner immediately thought my foot was hanging out of the shoe bc they thought the tan banding was part of of my heel. :)"

I usually have issues with  closed toe shoes (they bother me in the back). These shoes were very comfortable and did not bother me at all throughout the day. They are also very lightweight and of good quality. I loved them and would definitely buy another pair if I needed it.  Definitely recommend."

I wear a 7.5 and need a 6.5 in the mule style and 7 in the tie version I try to go with a double wide if available because they run very narrow and I have a small bunion on right and a fresh surgical recovery left foot happening These came with a flaw on leather hence the 4 stars"

Wore it all through Paris in the fall and everyone had sneakers on with their dresses because you walk everywhere.  I searched for a 2nd narrow pair and finally found it here on Amazon.  I love it!"

They're modern,  cool and comfortable.  I've gone to buy similar styles from other makers like puma and Adidas... but the comfort  doesn't come close."

    "message": "These shoes are a little too wide for a \"narrow\", but they're OK when I have them stuffed with my orthotics and insoles.  It's nice that the original insoles are removeable.  As another reviewer mentioned, the laces were white-white and the leather is more of an off-white which I didn't like, so I ordered some beige laces.  That added another $6.00 to an already high price for sneakers, but I'm used to that with a narrow foot."

    "message": "I love these shoes! I recently developed a Morton's neuroma on my right foot and was having toe pain, numbness, and tingling in my feet, making it hard to work out and walk. My podiatrist recommended dumping all my shoes that lacked any kind of support or comfort, so I went looking for new shoes that were both stylish and had the squishiness and support I needed. These totally fit the bill. They replaced all my basic white sneaks, but they're so comfortable and have allowed for less pressure so that I don't even feel any of the neuroma in the ball of my foot, which is allowing it to heal. I'm going to be buying more Naturalizers in the future!"

    "message": "These shoes feel nothing likely leather and more like a cheap, fake material. Left shoe already had a scuff on the toe with the material peeling. Tongue of the shoe was already very creased and you could see that with the normal bend of the foot with walking, the sole would soon separate from the rest of the shoe. Bummer since from a comfort standpoint, they were well-cushioned and I had planned to wear them for a European vacation. Returning immediately though. For $90, not worth the cheap product!"
