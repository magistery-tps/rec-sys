Wouldn't do anything longer than 15k on them, will never brake a personal record on them, but they cost at least half the price of all my other running shoes, which make this pair a pretty good option for daily trainers. Helps you balance out the wear of your other, more expensive, running shoes."

I will say though, my feet are wide and it is hard to find a 4E that is still wide enough and actually fits. I'm a Dunham, Brooks, Hoka 4E person. These brands, my little toe does not rub the outside. Asics, Saucony, New Balance, all of those 4E my little toe is still squished against the side. That is the case with these as well. So, if those brands fit you, these will be just fine. If those brands are slightly snug on you, these will be too. The length is spot on. The only other ding i'd give it is as soft and flexible as the sides are, really nice, the big logo on the side is fairly rigid and you can feel it on the side of your foot. Not rubbing to the point of blisters or anything, but you definitely know there's a big logo on the side of your shoe."

I went with the wife simply because of the shape of my feet, narrow/normal shoes just don\u2019t cut it anymore. When they arrived they looked great and when I went to try them on they were pretty snug but worked, was thinking they\u2019d be bit wider but they fit nicely. It\u2019s gonna take a a few walking sessions to get use to the fabric on the back of your heels or maybe wear some ankle high socks, otherwise it\u2019s gonna cause some irritation. To sum it all up I am happy with my purchase, they feel great and comfortable with their cushioning, they looks good and glad I took the plunge in these. Highly recommend, like I said it may take the heels some getting use to or wear out that fabric on the back of your heels so you\u2019re use to it."

After 10 years, I parted company with it and started searching for a replacement, only to be dismayed by what's on the market. It seems like the Trainers nowadays are competing for a beauty pageant -what with the colours and unnecessary accessories they attach to them.  I almost gave up till I came across these ones .... Black, Simple, Supportive and super comfortable - and it looks good with your workout gear. I have size 11 feet -long and narrow and got an 11, which fit perfectly - and it's half the price. What's not to like Buying a second pair pronto before they stop making them"

Sole shows no sign of wearing out even after daily (almost) use for 3 months 4. Light-weight 5. Top quality fabric material cons: 1. These are outdoor running shoes. Hence not that comfortable for casual wear due to the sole being harder. 2. I would have personally liked for the forward foot widget to be a little more. It's not that narrow though, but a slightly more width would have made the shoes more comfortable. In summary, none of the cons are deal-breakers. I recommend this shoe 100%, especially to road runners."

I have been using nike and Adidas for like 10 years now and this is my first time using under armour for myself. I am in awe of how comfortable they feel to the feet. Like you are not wearing any thing in your feet but you have no issues in running / jogging. Recommend it to everyone else."

My previous pairs of shoes have always been Nikes - I came from the Monarch (robust, heavy, interior wore down really fast) and before that, the Downshifter 11 (very light, but slippery sole that wore out pretty fast). This was my first piece of UA apparel ever - I was really impressed with the build quality and how light/minimal these shoes were. The heel cup shape is really well pronounced, you feel like your heel is locked in place really well. This is often an overlooked part of any pair of sneakers or performance related shoes, especially at this price point. The upper is very lightweight, it feels like nothing and breathes really well. The sole itself is supportive and somewhat rigid, giving the shoe a pretty good road feel which I felt like my previous pairs of Nikes were missing (they felt more squishy/soft, lost their support quite fast). I was eyeing them on Zappos for a while, but saw they were on sale even further on Prime Day, so got these for $41 which I felt was an amazing price point. Really satisfied with my purchase, looking forward to potentially getting more UA shoes in the future once these wear out."
