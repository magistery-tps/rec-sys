Because of the design of the sole, they are very stiff while walking which makes them kind of loud (clog-like) which isn't ideal. However I have plantar fasciitis and these seem to have helped quite a bit. My feet are still a bit sore after being on my feet all day, but not like how they were months ago, where I could hardly walk at the end of the day."

These shoes give me that small boost in height I was looking for without being too \"platformy\" and making walking awkward, or turning my ankles. The shoes are not as flexible or springy as they appear. The webbing is stiff plastic that has rubber pads on the bottom. Perfect for my purpose, but if you're looking for a soft, flexible shoe, you might want to keep looking. They're of decent comfort level. I usually wear a size 7.5, though that can vary based on brand. I bought an 8 in these and they fit snugly -- not overly tight, but snug when wearing a cotton jersey sock. I'm not planning long walks in them, so I can't testify to that aspect of comfort, but for biking long distances, these shoes were perfectly comfortable. They didn't have any rough edges on the interior to rub the foot. The rubber pads were nicely non-slip on the pedals. They don't need the laces. In fact, I took them out. They fit like a \"sock shoe,\" completely enveloping the foot. I bought the red for high visibility and the color is bright as I'd hoped."

I have Osteoarthritis,  fibromyalgia,  RA,  Lupus & back issues so finding a good shoe is very important. I put these on today before shift just to \"break\" them in before I wear them for an event I'm going to.( walking around Pittsburgh  & going to a Steelers game). My feet didn't hurt all night & when I took them off my feet still felt wonderful. I'm normally very picky about my shoes & pay a lot for comfort & only have a few kinds that give me the support & comfort that I need. I bought these to go with my steeler stuff primarily,  but was told by a nurse how comfortable they are & affordable so I figured I'd try them even if I only wore them a handful of times. I'm  definitely impressed with these & am going to be ordering more.  I got them faster then I thought I would too. Definitely on my list of top shoes."

These immediately felt comfy and formed to my foot! I will say the back by the ankle is a little tight so u may want to get a half to full sz bigger, But I ordered my normal sz and they fit snug. I will post another update when I have worn them at least a month!!! great choice! also the back when u grab to put your shoes on is a little shorter then I am used to, SO with a wider ankle or some one who needs ankle support,you may need the higher back/ankle shoes"
