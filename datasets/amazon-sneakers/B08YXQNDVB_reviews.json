I ordered the same size 11 - but when they were delivered they was way short in the toe. I returned them and got the replacements yesterday in size 11.5 US men. I am wearing them today for the first time, and I honestly could have gone to size 12 primarily based on my big toe on both feet. If you're moving from an older version, consider sizing up. But Amazon is awesome and will sort you out if you need to exchange. I did not deduct a star since I bought a new model without trying on (but I own more than a couple of New Balance all in size 11)."

I thought ahead and bought myself a pair of memory foam insoles to go with the shoes because I\u2019ve been having heel pain, and I\u2019m glad I did. They are not comfortable at all, at least not for me without a good pair of insoles. Once I put my fave insoles in them they are good to go. I love the colors of these shoes. We\u2019ll see how long they hold up but for now I am happy with my purchase."

Despite ordering my typical size for NB these were a bit snug but more importantly they just felt cheap. For the price I wasn't expecting the top of the line, but these just were uncomfortable beyond being tighter than I expected, the foot bed felt hard, and I didn't have confidence they would last very long (my pair of 1540s last more than a year despite me being a very heavy set guy). If they had fit I might have tried a different insert, but overall, I decided to go with the more expensive New Balance."

Not a lot of support in the shoe which I prefer, but somehow they seem to keep my feet feeling engaged and ready for whatever I'm doing.

Size is true to fit and plenty of space in the shoe without allowing your foot to move around so much it causes blisters and irritation. I never write reviews, but these shoes are worth it. I bought for around $50 which easily in a retail store would have spent $150."

The SOLES are very hard. Very uncomfortable to walk on hard surfaces. Feels like they are made of wood or like walking on cheap, thin, flip flops. The rubber lugs \"KLONK\" when I walk on our hardwood floors. Leather soled shoes are quieter. Not at all like my 160 dollar pair of NB shoes. So I guess you don't get what you don't pay for. I notice the color description problem in ALL the NB shoes I've bought in the last ten years or so. One of the colors they seem proud of is called \"Pigment\". Really? You name a color \"Pigment\"? I think that means \"All the left over dye we had left in the vat, mixed to a general dark grey/purple/brown."

    "message": "Pros: \u2022 New Balance, styling is alright. \u2022 The length fits as it should. Cons: \u2022 Trainers are cheap feeling, comparable to shoes worth half the price. You can see the glue. \u2022 The insole is poorly padded, but switchable. \u2022 The colour of the mesh isn't true black. The middle part has a warm (red) tone to it and not as black as the suede at the front. \u2022 The suede is thin feeling; I can't see these lasting very long if used off-track. They're definitely a dress trainer, but maybe only for going to the local pub or shop. \u2022 The sole is narrow, it feels like they need to be an inch wider as it feels like my feet want to flow over them like how muffins want to escape their wrapper. The mesh sort of bundles them up in an unsupported manner, which creates a rubbing problem with the rigid suede at the back. For reference they are 7 cm wide and my feet are 8 cm wide at the narrowest part. The front of the trainer is good enough for toes to wiggle though. I'll list dimensions below... Dimensions of sole: Heel 8 cm width Middle 7 cm width Front 11 cm width Inside of the trainer is 28 cm length (11 inches for UK size 11). \u2022 Even though I only tried them on for about 5 minutes I developed a short moment of plantar fasciitis pain in the arch of my left foot. To reiterate something I've said before, \"I don't like buying clothes online. You just don't know what you're going to get\". \ud83d\udc4e"
