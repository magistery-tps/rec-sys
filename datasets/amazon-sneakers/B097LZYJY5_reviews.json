So if you have orthotics that you have to insert in the shoe don't buy these shoes. Either that or I guess you could buy them two sizes too big but sadly I'm going to have to return them. So disappointed."

While you can find these easily in men\u2019s sizes, they\u2019re hard to find in women\u2019s, and my little feets are too tiny to fit in men\u2019s. To boot (pun intended), they\u2019re wicked comfortable! Love these. Hoping they\u2019ll some day have an all gray with a tan tread. One can hope\u2026"

I have various foot and chiropractic issues that make shoe shopping a drudgery for me, because even if a pair of shoes feels comfortable at first, it isn't long before I have some kind of pain and/or even nausea.  New Balance has been the one brand that always has a shoe that finally works for me, and this pair is perfect! They are advertised as black and gray, but they are actually navy blue, and I prefer the navy!  I am a very happy and satisfied customer!"

Shoes that have arches built in often hit me in wrong spot amd cause severe nerve pain and so many brands are ruled out. I decided to try NB again and these had a high cup heel and reviews said cushiony sole. So I got thwm. I LOVE THEM!!! And size is perfect for my sz 7 foot. One foot is slightly wider as I broke all 5 tarsal bones, but my heel is narrow. These are wonderful."

    "message": "I work on my feet all day for 10 hour shifts on concrete. I need a shoe that's supportive, comfortable, durable, and lightweight. I've only had these shoes for a day and I can say so far they're comfortable, supportive, and lightweight. The first thing I noticed is they're very true to size. I typically wear a 43 EU wide shoe, so I checked the size chart and ordered the corresponding 11 wide. They fit like a glove right out of the box. I also like the wide variety of colors they come in. It's very hard to find fun, colorful shoes if you have larger feet, much less ones that also come in wide widths. So finding these in my size was a huge plus (I got the raspberry and electric lime on black). I like the thin, stretchy heel cup that hugs my heel rather than the typical thick, plushy heel cups that most shoes have, which is just foam that covers a sharp plastic stabilizer. The first place my shoes always wear out is the heel cup, and I'm being stabbed in the heel with that plastic stabilizer. I'm hoping this shoe won't have that issue due to the different heel cup design. They are definitely supportive and I can feel the arch support on the inside of my feet. I tend to underpronate so arch support is important for me. While they are true to size, there isn't much vertical room in the shoe for any additional insert. I typically put some odor eaters inserts in my shoes (again, 10 hour shifts) and they made the shoe a little snug on top. I'm sure they'll loosen up as they wear in, but it's something to keep in mind if you typically wear an orthotic or use another type of insert. They're also very lightweight. I don't feel like I'm clunking around in a heavy brick of a shoe, like I sometimes get with very cushiony shoes. Shoes that are too heavy tend to fatigue my feet and legs after long shifts. They're not so light that I forget I'm wearing a shoe, but they're also not noticeably heavy either. I wish the toe box was just a little wider, but it's not squishing my toes a noticeable amount. I just tend to prefer a wide, roomy toe box. This one is probably a little wider than a typical athletic shoe, but just not as wide as I wish it was. Overall, so far very happy with the shoe. Will update if I run into any problems, but if they continue to perform excellently I can see myself buying another pair."

The 8s in these shoes were too tight and too small. Exchanged for 81/2 and they fit much better. I work in health care so I bought to wear with figs. So yes, they\u2019re really cute, but size up."

I ordered them in August and it\u2019s only the beginning of October and the toe is starting to break through. I even tried to order a men\u2019s size but the toe was even smaller and tighter so I don\u2019t think a men\u2019s would hold up any better."

The only issue I\u2019ve had is the back of the shoe rubs the Achilles (back of foot). If you put bandaids on, it\u2019s perfectly fine (yeahhh\u2026 I\u2019m that person, haha!) but other than that, THEY ARE WORTH EVERY CENT! I only gave 3-4 stars because I\u2019m tired of buying bandaids \ud83d\ude02"
