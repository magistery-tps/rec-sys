My husband and I went to Toronto and Niagara Falls back in August and I wore these everywhere we walked, which was a lot. I'm writing this review nearly 3 months after getting them, and as much as I'd like to share some photos, I'd rather save myself the embarrassment cause of how dirty they've gotten. I fully plan on getting them in other colors. I've gotten compliments on these from both men and women. Let's be honest, if you slapped a Nike or Adidas or even Balenciaga logo on these, people would be drooling all over them. But for now they're just these underrated shoes off of Amazon. If you like how they look, get them. They're worth it."

They look nice & make my foot look slender. They are not so easy to slip into - have to work at getting them on but the price is lower than other brands so worth the effort. Time will tell if they hold up after normal wear."

They are really comfortable and the material is like a sweater but it stretches to your feet.  I am very pleased with purchase and will likely buy other colors. The insert is removeable so you can add your favorite ortho insert depending on your needs. They are very lightweight. Thanks!"

The length of the shoe is just slightly shorter than it's described size. I comfortably fit an 11 and in these my toes are hitting the top of the shoe. Definitely not an 11. Style wise they're very cute but that doesn't keep your feet from hurting. If you're not a size 11 order a size up and get a little more room in the toe box."

I would recommend buying a size up from what you wear or 1/2 size up because these literally are a chore to put on.  Taking them off is really easy however, each time I take them off the insert comes out and needs to be put back in.  Too bad they don't glue it in?  I definitely will buy more of these but just a size bigger next time just to have a little more wiggle room."

    "message": "These are a great every day shoe. They are extremely light weight. The insoles are lightly supportive - if you need a lot of support this is not the shoe for you. They hug your foot like a sock. If you can't bend down to pull on a shoe these will not work for you - they really do pull on like a sock. The toe and heel of the shoe have a very strange slightly rigid piece in them that reminds me of cardboard - it helps the shoe keep its shape but took a little getting used to as far as comfort. The shoe runs slightly small in length - my toes are at the end of the shoe so I'm not uncomfortable but on longer walks they would cause a lot of friction on the tips of the toes. The color of the shoe is true to the picture choices. I bought red and I really love how the color pops. The shoe does not provide ankle support so if you need that in a shoe this is not the shoe for you. I believe the shoe to be true to what is advertised. The cost of the shoe is exceptional."

The tops of the shoes are close fitting, with no fastenings, more like socks. What this means is that I can't just slide my feet in. I have to sit with my leg up on the bed or couch, and with a shoe horn to hold the back of the shoe in place, and pull them on. It is a bit of work, but so worth it, because then the rest of the day, my feet feel wonderful, and I have some arthritic toe knuckles. These shoes are so recommended for the wearable comfort, but I do want to be completely truthful and let people know. As for me, I am seriously considering getting a second pair."

For me at first I didn\u2019t care at all but after wearing a few times this week now I can feel the sole moving out of place with every step I take. At first it would only move when I took off the shoe. I love how it wraps your ankle but it can look plain and weird when u wear long black pants because it kind of blends and looks boring. I\u2019d suggest leggings so u can see the shoe pop more! The shoe is also kind of bent forward. So u feel like your standing up straight while simultaneously doing a Michael Jackson and leaning forward somehow. Can feel a little weird so I suggest these shoes not be worn by older women especially if they\u2019re already becoming prone to falls and stuff. Even more since the sole moves! I\u2019d be scared to gift these to my 60 year old mom who has gotten clumsier. I\u2019m returning because these aren\u2019t really work shoes they\u2019re just on your feet all day shoes. I stubbed my toe with my ladder and it hurt so bad no protection the shoe feels very thin when u get hurt so it hurts even more since it bounces off nothing! I\u2019ve hit my toe with that ladder and the bottoms of my shoes usually stop it but these shoes are just not that type."
