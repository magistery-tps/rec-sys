These are great for the gym or running on a treadmill.  But if you like cushioning in your running shoe or run long distances or if your feet swell a bit,  these would not work for you.  I wouldn't wear these on a long pavement walk unless I replaced the insoles. If you like that \"barefoot running\" feel,  these might be ok,  but again,  it depends on the exact shape of your feet, size, or how much they would swell while running. For my purposes of travel, gym, etc,  I like the way they look and I'll be keeping them.  I got the ones that have a \"pink\" logo,  but it's more irradescent-pink-blue- silver,  depending on the angle.  I like that so it works for me."

The floral print on the straps is actually a bit larger than what looks like in the picture. The picture made the flowers look a little smaller but they were actually quite big in comparison. If it true to size I wear 10 women's and they fit perfect and I love that I don't I have to mess with laser. I've been trying laces for 30+ years I don't need to prove to anybody that I can lol. they're more of a pain when they keep coming untied, and it's legit just easier to slide them on and not worry about it. I almost bought another pair because the sale that was going on in the moment had dropped like 20 something off the price and it was hard to pass up but then I realized it wasn't in my size at that price so I had to pass it up unfortunately but I will be keeping an eye out for a gray pair because I don't have that color yet and I'm covering my neutrals first lol. I work as an on-site break fix tech so there are some days where I am walking all around different buildings to go fix things and they're comfortable. I feel like I'm like my old Nikes that I replaced with these adidas, my toes have more room to move in the shoe they don't feel super cramped in tight in the toe box. But I also don't really have wide feet I have like average to mildly narrow. I can wear this with very slim no show style socks or even slightly thicker more athletic padded socks and they both feel comfortable. The thick one sometimes even help with making my feet not slide too much cuz I do have to walk up and down a hill sideways sometimes which is awkward on the feet and the thicker socks help with the sliding."

I love the cloudfoam in the shoe it helps a lot these are the only type of walking shoes i enjoy because i hate tying my shoes i can just slip into them and get going. Im looking forward to buying more colors if the price stays right most definitely will be buying more pairs."

Of course you have to be careful with the white but that\u2019s to be expected because, well, ya know, white. If you like Adidas and like comfort, buy these. Just A tip but not THE only tip: Keep checking the prices because they fluctuate drastically. I saw them as high as $61 and change."

    "message": "I have high arches so it\u2019s difficult for me to find comfortable shoes. Many arch supports in shoes aren\u2019t in the right position to support mine, and my arch makes my foot a bit taller so shoes can feel pretty tight. These fit great and are super comfortable. I used to wear Nike\u2019s Revolution 4 running shoes that fit really well, but I couldn\u2019t find them anymore for a decent price. They also had pieces of plastic or something on the heel to keep the heels up straight, which would sometimes give me blisters, especially when the fabric covering them started to wear out after a couple years. These Adidas shoes do not have that. They\u2019re a durable fabric all around and super lightweight. There doesn\u2019t seem to be plastic at the heel, and I\u2019ve never gotten blisters from them even after wearing them long distances. I\u2019ve had them for a few months now and wear them everywhere - school, grocery shopping, walks, etc., they\u2019re great. I also like that they don\u2019t have laces and are easy to put on. I recommend giving them a try, especially if you can try them in a store or use Prime Try Before You Buy / Wardrobe."

However when I tried it on and walked around, the heel area felt like it was slipping up and down as I stepped, which did not invoke a feeling of confidence when walking. Furthermore, it felt longer than my usual foot size. I have a shoe size of between 6.5-7, and I also have an Adidas Advantage in 6.5 which fits like a glove. This was a bit larger than 6.5, so I might want to try a 6. Again, this may be due to the lack of laces and the fact that I have skinny ankles lol. Will return and try a size down. ;) Otherwise, a sleek and cool looking shoe, with nice padding."

I won\u2019t be able to get the correct size so I\u2019m just going to keep these.

They wear out faster than other shoes but worth it for the benefits and price. I've has 5 pair already and will continue buying them."

They fit perfectly and as a 6\u20192\u201d (188cm) woman I have particularly large feet and having the right size in a woman\u2019s shoe makes all the difference. Shipped super fast and living in Alaska that shocked me how fast they were here. Much appreciated. Anywho that\u2019s all just buy them you know you want to love. Treat yourself they are amazing."
