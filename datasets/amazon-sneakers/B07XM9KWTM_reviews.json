It has room at the toes where I find a lot of Converse are uncomfortable at the toes and I was worried with the little lift it would pinch toes but it doesn\u2019t.  They are wearing quite well, and like other Chuck Taylors I own, the white trim clean super easy so it looks pretty new with very little cleaning."

I chose to order a 6 so i could have some room and so i wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the shoe being small, because of course it will eventually fit if it ends up too big!
