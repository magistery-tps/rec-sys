The high tops stayed on - but of course all that lacing and unlacing was a bit of work to go through for daily wear.  Finally I tried these knit version - resisting for a while thinking they'd look like imposters and lose the whole cool aspect of the originals - and I immediately fell in love; the fit, comfort, support and ease to pull on/off is huge improvement - and they have at least 99% of the cool factor of the originals. The don't run quite as oversized as classic Chucks - for point of reference I'd wear a size 7.5 in men's (while my normal size is 10.5 women's).  However, in these knit version for Women, I wear a 9.5 women's.  Still a whole size down. I wear them with moderately thin socks - not dress socks, but not thick athletic socks.  If I put on athletic socks they'd be too tight. So I suppose if I wanted to wear thicker socks, I'd have to get a 10 (only 1/2 a size smaller than my norm).  If you have average width feet (not narrow like mine), you might even find that they fit true to size without sizing down at all."

    "message": "These are lighter than regular converse. When they arrived I thought at first they had sent the wrong shoe. The laces are short and we\u2019re tied in a knot on top of the 4th eyelet, and I don\u2019t care for that style. But I loosened the knots, then ran the laces over the eyelet, instead of under it, then tucked it in, which gives you the look they picture here. Once I realized I could do that successfully, I decided to keep the shoe. It squeezes a bit on the top of the foot. Hopefully that will loosen up, and my 6 1/2 feels more like a 7, but with the squeeze on the top of the foot, so slightly larger than normal and a top of the foot squeeze if you have high arches."

I was surprised how easily they slipped right onto my foot.  I really could have gotten away with a 9 or 9 and 1/2. That's unusual with my feet, because most of the time I have to size up.  If your feet are wider than a medium width these are super comfy but keep in mind the size, I would order at least a half size down."

They feel like they could  be comfortable. Returning to exchange. I like them regardless of the size issue. Ordered another 1/2 size down bringing the total size down 1.5 from my smaller general size. Mens sizes?  Will update. Update : from a 7.5 to a 6, could probably do a 5.5. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m going to keep them. They fit better with a light ankle sock. It prevents them from slipping off in the back. They\u2019re cute but not on my thin legs. Maybe with pants but for the price, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s worth it. I took a star off for the hassle/fit and another for the cost. They are light weight. Not sure what it is but look super long. A lot of people have said they are for narrow feet. I don\u2019t find that."

Would have been totally pleased had they arrived in a Converse box. They were just placed in a shipping box. Recommended"

I am over 40 and have never worn this brand until these this past summer. Being a nurse, I have worked in these a couple of times and they held me up great!!!! I wear between a 10-11 depending on the brand. I wear a 10 in these and it is a perfect fit! The other different makes of this brand seem to hurt my toes but these don\u2019t."

My feet are super \u201caverage\u201c in width \u2014 so not wide.  Since they are kind of knit, I\u2019m hoping they will loosen up. Otherwise, I\u2019m feeling very stylish in these Chucks!"

I bought the yellow, quality appeared to be great but the size is not working for me so I will return and keep looking for another product that fits better.  Very disappointed."
