Now, Disney requires a lot of walking. So I wore these shoes for a few days and even exercised in them (walking long distances). At first I really enjoyed them. Felt comfortable, highly breathable, and stayed cool in the summer heat (purchased light grey for that reason). However, eventually on a normal walk, my feet started to cramp & I could feel the lack of arch support. My feet and ankles were killing me for the rest of the day. I knew I would never be able to wear them like normal shoes again. These will now be my kayak shoes only (which they will function great for). Not Disney World shoes for long walks, unless your arch can take it. I may still throw them in my bag, idk, for when the rain at the park does hit. Pros: - lightweight - generally comfortable - highly breathable - water proof - stay cool in heat - fit normal shoe size Cons - no arch support - uncomfortable bumpy sole design - definitely don\u2019t wear in the rain unless you\u2019re expecting to allow the water to go through them"

While they are comfortable, traditional ones still have it a little better. These are nice as they are airy and lightweight. They don't offer much by way of arch support. And they do tend to track hair around the salon in the way that the slides don't. Still hold their value and I'd recommend them."

They are roomier but a little too big in the toe box even with footsies.  I will return them. They are lightweight.  The grooves on the inner sole are what also prompted me to use the footsies...  I don't find the grooves comfortable at all. I purchased these trying to find support and relief from walking around the house in flat shoes or socks, which does my feet and legs no favors. I think 1/2 sizes would be a good idea. I have pictured my toes sticking up to show how much room is left in the toe box after sizing up to size 10."

    "message": "Great shoe for heel impact. Very spongy.  The tongue on the shoe is sewn in and part of the shoe and not separate so if you a high instep it could feel tight.  However, I own a lot of croc shoes and find that they do stretch a bit after wearing them.  I wear these for tennis and never have pain in my heel. Your foot can get sweaty and squishy since it is rubbery inside but it doesn't impact my playing or walking. I dont wear socks since I find it more comfortable without them.  They are light and I have traveled with them as well. True to size . I'm normally a 9 and got a 9 and they fit perfectly."

    "message": "There are many things I like about these shoes. They\u2019re waterproof, pretty cute,  comfortable footbeds. But the problem for me is that if I wear a liner sock or go sockless, the shoe rubs the back of my heels and causes blisters. There is something hard, almost sharp, on one of my shoes. My foot was literally bleeding after only a couple hours of wearing them with a liner. On the other hand, if I wear them with a sock that covers my ankle, it\u2019s enough cushion to protect my foot and this doesn\u2019t happen. This is annoying because I actually bought these shoes to wear to theme parks, etc, places where my feet would get wet, and the whole idea was to not wear socks. So they are pretty useless for the intended purpose. In my opinion this was a lot of money to spend on shoes that make my foot bleed. Also, something I could deal with but will note here, the sizes seem quite narrow to me. If you don\u2019t have a very narrow foot, I would suggest getting the mens or youth styles, as they give a little more room width wise. Just subtract two from your woman\u2019s shoe size and that\u2019s your man/youth size. I considered doing this and wish I had."

Compared  to my reg crocs, the sole is much thinner and harder and believe  me, your foot feels it. So sent them back with a heavy sigh \ud83d\ude15 The search for my perfect summer  shoes continues"

    "message": "Sorry Crocs, the size works as expected. However the quality does not match the croc\u2019s name. They are advised as arch supporting but they are flat. When walking on the beach, sand accumulate inside the shoe so you\u2019ll find yourself constantly removing your shoes to dump sand out or your walking on sand inside the shoe. The first time even putting them on, the croc tab fell off. They\u2019re okay if you want something sorta stylish to wear at the beach but not for comfort and not literally on the beach/sand."
