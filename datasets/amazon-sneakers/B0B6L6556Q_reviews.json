    "message": "About a decade ago, fed up with modern sneaker styles that were not only horrible to my aesthetic sensibilities, but also absurdly expensive, I was at a loss about what to do. I kept buying Sketchers or New Balance sneakers but every trip to the shoe store was like a scavenger hunt, trying to find a model that didn't look horrible to me. Then, on a visit to sports retailer Academy, I ran into these. Since I'd had them when I was a kid and they were about $25 I decided to buy a pair. It was love at first walk. They are comfortable, breathe pretty well and you can even stick them on the washing machine when they get too grungy. Since they're mostly made out of nylon, they dry pretty quick. I've owned the black/white, black/black and grey/white models and all are great. When they wore out I bought a new pair and kept doing it through the years. Eventually the price went up to $29 and then, to my dismay, I could no longer find them at Academy. I asked the dude working there and he said they were discontinued. Don't know if that's true, but I found them on Amazon and I've been buying them ever since. Often several pairs at a time to have a couple of pairs on stand-by in case they do stop making them. The price has slowly climbed from $29 to $35 and now to around $40, so it's no longer a steal, though compared with most $100+ shoes, still a bargain."

In comparing with some other retro sneakers, the overall fit is similar to my NB 515s (which are rarely, if ever worn due to comfort for my foot). The only other knock I have on this shoe is the heel and height of the Achilles portion. It feels like my foot would frequently slip out if I wore these."

I wouldn't go hiking or play sports in them, but I can walk in them for several miles and feel fine.  They have a classic look, and their price continues to hold steady at ~$40.  I am very pleased with Reebok for continuing to make this classic sneaker with little to no changes.  My last pair wore out surprisingly quickly in the heel interior, but that's been my only real complaint I've had with any pair of these shoes. If you're particular, be aware that there are multiple slightly different \"Reebok Classic\" sneakers.  For my purposes, they're all about the same."

The cloth part of the tip's color gets a bit faded after a while since it's in the sun (which I love, it gets a really nice look, almost three different colors). The white part of the sole of the shoe is difficult to clean but stays clean for a long time, too. It's a very stiff shoe and it'll take a while to break it in. The only bad thing for me is that sometimes it looks too chunky, but that's just personal, there is nothing wrong with the shoe itself. Would recommend it."

In my experience their durability is as good as can be expected in a sneaker-- they are not, after all, USGI army boots-- and the fit is predictably comfortable.  As for the style, this is of course a matter of taste.  As a Baby Boomer I love the fact that these look like the running shoes of my youth, as opposed to the sculpted swoopy techno dayglo bizarro shoes one sees today.  Okay, that was judgmental, but this is an opinion piece, right?  Hipsters may love the Converse All-Stars that we also wore back in The Day, but let them try these on.  One day in these retro runners and they'll quickly know why, back in the 70s, we all ditched our Chucks for running shoes!"

The model number has changed a couple of times but I've always been able to track it across the model range and find the right shoe again.  A couple of times there were even notations pointing out that this one used to be called that one, etc. Some people are complaining that the quality has gone down since the manufacturing base for the shoe has changed; I haven't detected any change in quality and since I have literally been wearing this model of shoe for DECADES - not exagerrating at all, I first bought these in 1985 - I think those complainants are railing against foreign manufacturing rather than the shoe's actual quality.  Get over yourselves, people.  If you want domestically made shoes, they're out there.  Go buy those instead."

I understand the company has been going through some changes recently, but I didn't think their shoes would be so hard to find. I used to wear Reeboks when I was younger and wanted a changeup from Adidas and Nike, the latter of which has dropped significantly in quality. My last two pairs of Nikes have fallen apart after just a few months of normal non-athletic use. I like these classic nylons for the most part. They're comfortable and fit true to size. Fabric and sole quality seem to be up to par. The only thing I dislike is a cosmetic feature. The nylon part on the top of the toe area is much shinier than it appears in the listing photos. It's more like a glossy metallic gray, which gives the shoes a somewhat tacky appearance, but it's not intolerable. I'm not sure if different colors of the same style have the same problem, but I would hope not."

    "message": "I have been wearing this style of Reeboks forever.  They are light but supportive and very comfortable.  That's all that matters to me, yet it's not always easy to find that functionality in shoes when style rules the day.  I went into a Reebok outlet store recently and its obvious that the company has no tolerance for honoring this classic any more.  So Amazon was my last hope.  It worked out well.  They were a bit tight but they have been loosening up and are satisfactory.  I'm thinking that maybe I should have bought extras in case these really are impossible to obtain in the near future.  It's a consideration."

    "message": "I found this sneaker years ago where I live. I need a larger size (14) which is very hard to find. I usually had to end up wearing a size 13. I could not find them in my area anymore, but was able to find them on Amazon. I have since bought several pairs  of these over the years. As long as Amazon keeps stocking them, I'll keep buying them. I'm on my feet all day, so I need a shoe that's comfortable. A lot of the shoe is made out of nylon which I feel keeps my feet from sweating. The only disadvantage is rain or puddles, the nylon makes it easy for the water to soak through, but I still think it's a great sneaker. I think it's a great quality sneaker, they wear very well."

    "message": "I basically wore nothing but these shoes, when they were made by Adidas, back in the 1970's/early 80's. The fit and quality was great and you could really move in them. Of course, after they stopped making them and my last pair wore out I was out of luck.  I've had many other types of running/athletic shoes since, but always wished I could find some forgotten stash of that old Adidas model again.  When I saw these shoes I was pretty surprised and hopeful, but when I found out Adidas owned Reebok I got excited!  I have 3 pair now and I'm completely satisfied with them.  Same fit and feel, with the added bonus of remembering good times from the past each time I wear them.  If you remember these and liked them back then, do yourself a favor and get a pair.  You won't be disappointed."
