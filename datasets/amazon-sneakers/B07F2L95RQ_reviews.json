Ordered half a size up from usual and it fits fine at first but definitely not functional for long days. Cant seem to loosen it enough to be comfy and it would be too big if I went up a size. Have had better luck with other puma shoes for that balance between comfort and style"

It\u2019s not the most comfortable or supportive shoe, but the look makes up for it.  The sole is a little hard.  I only wear them on short outings right now, but I\u2019m still breaking mine in.  The size is pretty true to size, but if you have wider feet, you may want to consider going a half size up for more comfort.  They do kind of squeeze your toes.  Go ahead, get you a pair.  They will look great on you!! Enjoy."

    "message": "I bought size 8.5 because it is the size I wear and the feedback indicated that it should fit me well.  It is a shoe with a beautiful combination of colors, I am not a fan of the brand but I am always willing to try brands and this time I allowed myself to buy some comfortable shoes to wear with different styles. The front shape is somewhat strange, maybe it's just that I'm not used to this model, it looks like a duck head.  Something that is very important to me is that the leather is not too stiff, this one is quite stiff, in addition, the model is for a narrow foot (very narrow), my foot is not wide but roomy shoes are better for me. This model is quite narrow, it is felt especially in the front part where the laces start, my toes fell asleep in a couple of hours and without wearing socks, I will need very thin socks or I will simply wear them without socks.  The sole is quite comfortable, although a bit stiff. After all, you can see the good material and they look durable, despite everything, I hope they soften with some use, I really trust that hahahaha"

I\u2019m hoping they break in well, and thankful I have a desk job (not having to walk around a lot, since my feet are throbbing). It\u2019s not intolerable, but certainly tight. I love the colors, and it seems like they have some decent arch support (I only think maybe, it\u2019s hard to tell through the dull ache) I doubt this review helped too many people, but as the other reviewers say, size up!

The only issue is the tongue is really stiff and rubs against my foot as I walked, but the rest of the shoe fits as expected. My reorder arrived quickly and I gifted the size 8s to my friend - she loved them! I love this shoe for the style, but it is not comfortable. I read the reviews, so I knew when I purchased the shoe I was taking a chance, but I really like the style. The package arrived early, YAY! I tried on the shoe and it was as the reviews said, very narrow fit around the arch. Plus there is something about the design, whereas the tongue of the shoe can be uncomfortable. I wore them to drive my son to work and back home, I was fine. But unless the leather begins to breathe and loosen, I do not believe I will be able to wear them for more than an hour. My purpose for purchasing is for fashion, not sport. Therefore, I plan to keep them and as I do with heels; assign them a speed limit. ;-)"

You can easily make them comfortable by using a leather spray, or hair dryer for 20 seconds where they are tight. I use spray and walk around in them in the house until the spray dries and repeat as necessary. This takes weeks of breaking them in off. I would also recommend a shoe tree to keep them from creasing. A good show tree can also help stretch them. I am absolutely in love with these shoes! Will definitely purchase again!"

The tongues of these shoes are just as long as where the laces end and have a rather hard edge that are pushing into your feet.  Also, I have noticed that the piece that is hanging with the puma logo on the side is not leather, which piece goes all around where the shoe laces are. This makes me question which portion of these shoes are leather. The arch support I found OK as walking, but my feet lift out of the shoes when walking; no support for the heels at all. I am very disappointed and wonder, if anyone still made sport shoes out of real leather like earlier that I loved so much. These are a joke and will go back. The 2 stars are solely for the look and the shoe laces that have a nice heavy finish on the ends making them stay close to your feet. I am sorry for the less than desirable review, I  whish I had better experience with these."

Room for the toes, the heel is cushioned and the sole is comfy as well.

It almost drags my socks down which is annoying enough to take a star away. I have high arches - I'm assuming that's the cause. They're breaking in nicely though. I feel like these are more comfortable after a few weeks of wear and the tightness will be minimal after a few more weeks. I sprayed them with Scotchgard Fabric protector before wearing to prevent stains and provide a little water resistance. I'd 100% recommend that if you get the white versions too. I also noticed the California style being sold on Free People for $90 so I feel like the $32 I paid was an extra good deal now."

    "message": "First of all, my box arrived very wet. I'm assuming this is not the fault of the seller but happened in the transportation process. However, they arrived in a package with a pair of boots and the boot bag was not wet. This is the reason I'm not giving 5 stars. The shoes themselves are nice. I'm pretty sure that what I'm seeing on the inside of the right shoe is water damage and if I had paid $60 for these then I'd be more upset. I don't think these shoes are for anyone who don't have narrow feet. Pumas usually fit snug and these are no exception. The first night they were almost too tight on the tops of my feet but have plenty of toe room. I stuffed them with grocery bags for two days and now they're fine. They have good arch support and other than water damage, I'm happy with them."

They look great when I can squeeze my feet into them, but then I suffer if I wear them for more than about an hour. I would definitely return these if I hadn't missed the return window."

I had to leave early and take a lot of breaks from walking because my feet were killing me. I\u2019ve never had a pair of sneakers do that before. I would\u2019ve returned, but I paid $12 for shipping so I just gave them to my mom, her feet are smaller than mine. She hasn\u2019t worn them yet. I\u2019m so bummed they didn\u2019t work out because I love the look of them."

They are very uncomfortable don't wear if you're doing a lot of walking, at least until they are broke in. Been on my feet all day and they about near killed me. After wearing them for a while I'm a little disappointed.  The toe is cream the rest of the shoe white,  they look dirty even though they are brand new.  I have boney feet and they rub and hurt my feet every time I wear them, especially the left one,. It rubs on the bone of my left foot and leaves my feet absolutely killing me. Will never buy again."

FYI, my feet are also wide width, so normal size shoes does sometime fit tightly (especially stilettos) or not at all. It is a bit sturdy at first (typical of leather), but will loosen up after some time. I am very satisfied with my purchase and my decision to take one true to size."
