They have actually improved it over the years (like a late model car vs a first run). With the last set, the tongues were a little short and uneven between the two. The top of the left one was only just above the laces. This set I just bought (8/22) the tongues are exactly how they should be. The only thing I would change is that they skipped having a \u2018center lace loop\u2019 - a single lace retainer at the base of the tongue between the bottom left and right rows that pulls the toe area up as laces are tightened. This certainly isn\u2019t a dealbreaker at all, but just seems like it should have been there in the design of this model. Will buy again!!! Please don\u2019t discontinue!!!"

In addition, Skechers are incredibly underpriced, compared to ALL other top brands. They also tend to wear better than any other brand, with the possible exception of New Balance. I love the new Skechers Stamina Nuovo Cutback shoes I just bought. It occurs to me, Skechers ought to make automobile tires, as the treads on my new shoes grip the surfaces like nothing I've ever experienced! Be careful! Don't \"shuffle\" when wearing a pair of these shoes. Will I buy again? Yes, Tony! Yes, Howie! Yes, Ringo!"

    "message": "First off, let me just say that these shoes are awesome! PROS: - Well-built - Durable - Great support - Handles abuse quite well - All-around champ CONS: - Price I usually go through shoes pretty fast, because I work in manufacturing, and am constantly moving around for 12 hour shifts. When I'm not working, I am doing something outside, usually hiking or camping. These shoes handle it all, and even after a long day, my feet still aren't sore. I wanted a strong, durable shoe that would last, because I got tired of shelling out money literally every month for a new pair after the old ones bit the dust. So, I finally broke down, and bought a pair of Nuovos; I'm really glad I did! I originally bought these May 27th, and with Amazon Prime, they arrived fast as ever. Well, it's now September 10th, and they're still going strong, although starting to show their age in places. After 4 months, the are just now starting to have some frayed stitching in the front, loosing a slight bit of spring in the support, and the tongue tends to slide under the laces. But then again, that's 4 months of heavy use and abuse. I'm pretty hard on my shoes, and usually toss them in the washing machine and dryer at least every 2 weeks, if not more. Not your typical shoe-cleaning practice, I know. But they've taken it like champs. The only reason I am starting to think about getting another pair now is because they are (very) slowly starting to go out on me, and, it would just be nice to have another pair handy and already broke in when they do go. But for now, they're still in good condition to work. I really like the support these shoes offer, first and foremost. These are literally a shoe that is comfortable wearing all day long. My feet don't get super hot, like other shoes do (although more ventilation could be a plus). The traction and grip of these shoes is pretty good - a lot better than many of the shoes out there in retail-store-world, anyway. I also really like the amount of padding that went into the shoes, especially around the heel and sides of the foot - it gives a nice snug, secure feel. These things are also tanks! They take whatever you throw at them, and keep on trucking. When I go hiking, I'm usually wearing a 40-80 pound pack (depending on number of people and duration), and for that reason, usually switch to my good 'ol trusty Danners for ankle support. However, this summer, the Danners stayed in the closet, and I just went with these, and had no problems at all. In response to some of the reviews out there on the Internet saying that these shoes cause you to loose balance - I honestly can't confirm nor deny that. I will admit that, at times, I imagine it looks like I'm a drunken fool bumbling around, but I can't honestly tell if that's the shoes, or just me being my normal, uncoordinated self (after all, I trip over my own feet... soooo). As far as that aspect, I really can't weigh in with an honest answer, although I can say that I don't believe the shoes cause any unbalance issues. All in all, I would highly recommend these shoes. Sure, for my size (14M), they're a bit expensive, but when you consider the price of one pair over 4-5 months vs buying a new pair of shoes every month, I suppose it's all worth it in the long run. Honestly, these are great shoes, and stand up to whatever you need them for. And, with Amazon, you not only get them fast with Prime, but if you don't like them, Amazon's really good about returns, so there's honestly no reason not to at least try them!"

    "message": "Have to say that these are the BEST shoes I've had, EVER.  I have arch and foot problems, flat feet, arthritis, etc.  My Podiatrist (foot doctor) told me to wear tennis shoes at work if I possibly can, which I can, so I did.  I originally bought these shoes in grey, at a local store a few years ago, wore them for about 2 years, and now they are worn out (will use for mowing shoes now)...but I loved them so much in 2011 that I bought a 2nd pair a month after the 1st pair in 2011 just in case and kept them in the closet these last 2 years for when the old pair wore out. I have to say that I wore the first pair for 2+ years and they brought tons of comfort and needed support to my flat feet with no arches with arthritis.  Over the years I've also had a hard time finding sizes and anything that fits.  I wear Men's size 12/13 depending on the manufacturer, and these shoes actually come in a \"Wide\" version which is RARE! I not only have a hard time finding size 13 but rarely find WIDE in Size 13!!!!! BONUS! I thought I would never find any shoes that fit me PERFECTLY!  These are the best damn shoes I ever had the privilege of wearing plus I go through shoes a lot, wearing the soles down mostly, but not these! I haven't had any issues with these over the years but only one minor issue...the only issue I had was with the bottom rubber part of the heel came loose a litte but I bought some rubber cement (that professional shoe repair shops use) and I glued them back on perfectly.  Of course this was after 2 years of wear and tear so I expected something (very minor in IMO) especially after wearing them day in and out for over 2+ years. I don't think I ever had shoes this comfortable in all my life, EVER! Seriously, I'm not only impressed, but I purchased a new pair right now because I love these so much-just in case they don't make them again I'll be good for 4 years (current one is new and these will be stored away or worn in conjunction to my other new pair).  The other day I finally broke out my 2nd pair that I bought back in 2011 because those 1st pair took a major beating every day to work, weekends, etc. Now I'm on my 2nd pair I bought in 2011, grey color, but I searched and found these on Amazon and decided to order these in dark navy for a change, same thing; 13 Wide for about the same price I purchase them in 2011! I can only say that if you have general foot issues, arch problems, flat feet, arthritis in your feet, anything, just give these babies a try. Do your yourself a favor and seek relief from these shoes, I did and have been very happy over the past few years.  The extra bonus is they look nice too, unlike some ugly brands out there. I'm sure you will be impressed and overjoyed with the comfort and smooth stride in every step! Happy Travels"

Is this a temporary quality issue due to pandemic? I have started searching for other quality brands."

The problem is I never take them off - including wearing them while painting on a renovation project, with predictable results. Forgetting to take them off after gardening or change into something else before gardening. Perfect fit for my wide (& flat) feet. Great product."
