They still require sitting down to put them on. They are not loose enough to slide into like a deck shoe, but I like the fit.  They are supportive of my feet and do not ride up and down on my heel. They also have a comfortable amount of toe room. Right out of the box I would recommend thinner socks for the best result. Overall for the money they are hard to beat imho!"

    "message": "These are not \"Slip on\" shoes, they are \"Pull on\" shoes. The first time I put them on I ended up sitting down on the floor and pulling hard on the back straps to get them on. I thought for sure they would be too tight. Once on, they were snug but I decided to walk a mile or two. They were snug, but not bad. Now, after a couple dozen miles they fit fine. The widest area across the ball of my foot is still just a bit snug, but I don't even think about it. My feet do not slip or slide around inside them while walking on pavement or sidewalk, but I don't think they would be very good for trail hiking or serious running since there is no way to adjust them. The size I wear is 8.5 medium width and I ordered the generic 8.5. This shoe would not work well for someone with wide feet.  I am pretty certain that after breaking them in a size 9 would have ended up too loose for me, though. So far there is no sign of wear on the sole or heel and I am surprised since I walk pavement and I tend to wear the outside of my heels very quickly."

I went with the size Amazon recommended and it is about a 1/2 size too small, although it may stretch to fit after wearing. Looks and material were good. It was too small to \"slip-on\" or even pull on without help. I used a boot pull hook on the heel loop and this worked well to pull back and then up. This isn't a running shoe, but should be OK as a walking shoe if you get the proper fit. My experience is get 1/2 size larger."

I have back issues so slip on shoes that are actually comfortable and act like shoes are very nice to me. I\u2019ve only had these for about a week so far and I do like them but my feet still take a little bit wearing these, and it may just be because they\u2019re so new.

These soles don't last long playing Basketball on a tennis court. But, affordable. At first tried 1/2 size down bc they seem to get looser in the heel after taking them on/off frequently, then ordered normal size and still uncomfortable due to width. They do look good with shorts, and team sweatpants when not wearing slides. Giving a 3 star for quality since they lose tread on the bottom so quickly.

The QR code on the inside of the shoe does nothing unlike my fathers, and that takes you to the Adidas website. As well as the soles on mine are completely different, mine are all black that had Adidas text on it but wore off the first day. His are the cloud foam sole. Don\u2019t get me wrong mine still feel great and I had no idea they could\u2019ve been fake until I saw my fathers. As far as mine they fit mostly true to size maybe half a size down but don\u2019t worry they do kinda stretch out so you can get a half a size to small and be fine. Comfort is great and I mostly bought them for work so my feet don\u2019t sweat and they do a great job at that. Ive used them pretty much everyday for 2-3 months and there is a small tear in the side stitching on the inside of the shoe."

There is very little tread on the bottom and you can see from the photo that the bottom wore out and got dirty from one or two walks on asphalt. I\u2019ve had them for a while now and have begun wearing them to the gym because they are lightweight, comfortable, and flat. I am able to squat, leg press, and do any other lift without any discomfort or fear of losing balance. I\u2019ve had no issues with these shoes except that I keep spilling my coffee on them. I do habitually drink a lot of coffee, but I make it my business not to spill coffee all over myself. Despite this, in the last couple weeks I have spilled coffee on myself three times and each time it has landed directly on these shoes. Last week my girlfriend split her coffee on her own Adidas (a different pair) and I think this is suspicious. If it happens again I will be looking for Adidas to address these concerns.

If I step in a puddle, the moisture will wick and my socks will dry out over the day, unlike with non-pourous shoes. The cloudfoam soles are super comfortable, although I wish they could hold their spring longer. The shoes are difficult to slip on at first, but after a couple days of wearing, they\u2019ll slip on easy, but not so easy that they slip off while running. Great shoes; I get lots of compliments."

I wear size 12 and they fit a little tight. They are not uncomfortable or anything but just a little tight. The shoe is incredibly light and they look very good. Got several compliments of how good they look. Definitely not for everyday usage. I like the shoe but I just dont love them. Wont be returning them or anything but this is not a shoe I would purchase again."

The one thing I'll say is that I had a pair of these previously, and decided to get a new pair since I wore the other ones out. These have a different material for the inside sole than the last one, which adds more friction to it when you try to slide them on. It smooths out after a while, but it just means that you'll have break in the shoes for a bit."

These shoes had a new insole design with an exposed solid foam construction instead of the insoles in previous  shoes that were covered with fabric. The foam insoles tore about a week in and had to be replaced. In a A second pair of shoes the insoles tore the second day they were worn! The foam insoles also broke to pieces when I tried to remove them and left bits stuck to the adhesive that had to be scraped off. The old version of the insoles were worn over a year with no problems or replacements necessary. Still love the style and ease of the shoe, but they need to go back to the old insoles."

Amazon took them back with no problem, and I reordered the shoes in a 7 1/2. Still, they seemed too big. I kept them even though I probably could\u2019ve gone down to a size 7, and honestly now that I\u2019ve worn them for a couple of months I love them. I think the feeling of them being too \u201croomy\u201d was throwing me off. And the inside of the shoe has a fabric that made it easy for my shoe to slide off the back of my heel when wearing socks very slightly when walking or running. However, my shoes never slipped off or fell off. Honestly, now I don\u2019t even notice the \u201cslip\u201d feeling. I don\u2019t know if that was a sensation I just had to get used to or what, but these shoes are so comfortable and I wear them for at least 10 hours everyday (I work in a factory). I hardly ever have foot pain anymore. I\u2019d definitely buy these again."

I've had 3 other pairs since, all of which no longer had the lumpy (but comfy) cloud foam, but still all more comfy than this current 4.0 iteration.

If these were half the price I\u2019d give them 4 stars for outright fit and performance as a throwaway shoe. If they had a layer of rubber under the heel and ball of the sole they\u2019d have 10x longevity, and they\u2019d be 5 stars at any price under 100$. Your mileage may vary."

I like the stretchband, its good design, not too narrow, not too strong. Updated: After a few weeks, the band area across bridge of my foot began to get very sore on extended walks. I tried stretching the band, different socks, nothing helped. Then I noticed that if you pull the band away from the shoe, there's a relatively thick, round, U shaped seam in the shoe material, hidden by the band. The band is compressing that seam into top of my foot in sensitive area, very uncomfortable. Going to donation pile. Other than that seam, loved the shoe. Mine was a tight fit anyway, YMMV"
