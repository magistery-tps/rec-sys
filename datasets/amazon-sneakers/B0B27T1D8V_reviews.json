They are easy to clean as well. He got some scuffs and dirt on them the first week of wearing and they came clean with soap and water. The sizing was perfect and they fit great. The price was much better than on the brands website, and shipping was as always fast since this was a prime eligible item."

They are super comfortable and good quality and feel exactly like my previously purchased Adidas so I know that these are real.  Would definitely recommend these because of the cheap price.

I'm not a fan of all the crazy colors and designs that are popular now, so I'm glad I can still find a basic pair of Adidas shoes that make me happy. I will never buy Nike, I'll go barefoot first. Skechers memory foam doesn't hold up long, so I try to steer clear of them. Used to like k-swiss, but their shoes hurt my feet. Doesn't leave me with many options!
