They also are not very cushiony so it makes them a little less comfortable than I had hoped for. I like them but if I had to do over I probably wouldn\u2019t buy them again."

Bought this for half the price! Oh yeah! Checked them out again a few days after I bought them and they were sold out here on Amazon. This is a hard to find color hence the reason for it excitement. Moving to the technical specs, it's a classic retro style (which seems to be the trend these days, it's like wishing back for the good old days when things were cooler and actually lasted, and they were cheaper too). They're comfortable out of the box, even without socks, no blisters formed, nothing rubbed against my heel, sides of feet, toes or anything like that. It's well constructed, sturdy, with suede leather parts on nylon, the stitching is well done and the gull wing is the kind of dark green I like. Tretorn is a classic brand and I'm a classic kind of person, I guess. I have worn them and walked quite a bit in them and my feet still feel good at the end of the day. Happy feet!"
