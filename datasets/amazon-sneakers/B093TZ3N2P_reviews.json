    "message": "I initially bought these in Olive size 9 which is what I am in my other Steve Madden Linqs sneakers but these were a very small fit. I could get my foot in but not walk in them so they were returned. They were gone in the 9.5 in the Olive so I bought the grey. Its a lovely light shade of grey and fit perfectly. I have a narrow foot. Listen to the reviews to size up a half size. The only reason they got 4 stars is they are scuffed on the backs of the heels when I took them out of the box and on the front of one shoe, the zips are extremley stiff to pull or down and they are not as high on the foot or the wedge as my linqs pairs. However, when I printed the return label for the olive pair and rang DHL for collection I was refunded immediately from Amazon which was fantastic and enabled me to buy the grey pair before they sold out. There will be a breaking in period I feel which there wasn't with my other pairs, I can wear those all day but these are fab. I would buy another if they were available in 9.5. :)"

I am on #4 since the show came on the market several years ago and I wear it non stop. Love the design, wide or narrow, it fits well. Great quality, easy to brush to clean, and there is always toothpaste to clear the sole."

    "message": "I just got these in the mail and I absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes. HOWEVER, I feel like I got a used/returned item. The shoebox itself had been torn up and taped back together. The bag the shoes were in had dirt on them making me question the storage condition of these shoes. The shoes themselves look fine until I put one on and noticed the inside lining on the right foot had apparently started to come off at the toe. The white around the bottoms was just a tad dirty but cleaned right off with a magic eraser. The right seam on the heel also looks a little worn. So far it doesn't feel like enough to go through the hassle of a return as the shoes still look great, but I haven't decided yet. I read the reviews that these fit small so I sized up 1/2 a size and even then is a little snug. Also, after walking in these shoes for like 10 minutes, the white bottom already looks a little squished by the ball of my foot. I like the look of the zippers down so I'm not worried about them breaking but I could see how others say they don't work very smoothly. So overall thoughts are I LOVE these shoes but I'm very worried they won't last. I will update in about a month!"

Sooooo...I first bought a cheap knock-off pair for a third of the cost\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.  I am writing this review to stop you from making the same mistake!!  Just bite the bullet & pay for a quality product.  The cheap pair looked cute enough, but after a few hours I could really feel them cutting into my toe box.  I was stubborn & wore them several more days, hoping it would get better as they stretched out, but I always left work limping.  Just awful!  Cheap construction, too.  Stitches were already going. Last week I went ahead & purchased this Steve Madden pair and have been wearing them all week to work.  So happy with these shoes!!!  I had read other reviews mention needing to size up, so I decided to order an 8.5 instead of my usual 8.  I think I made the right decision.  I wouldn\u2019t want them any tighter.  The first day my inside right foot felt the zipper more than the left, but eventually it stretched a little & I haven\u2019t felt it since.  Perfect shoe for dressing down but still looking cute.  Quality construction\u2014these will last a while.  No regrets!!"

I thought they looked cheaply made, stiff/cardboard like, and they are definitely made for a narrow foot.  I normally wear a 5.5 or 6 regular, but these were unbearably painful on my piggy toe.  So I had to return them. I know some people mentioned going up half a size, but that\u2019s never an option for me given the stiffness of the shoe that would\u2019ve made them too clunky and loose around my ankle."

It felt at least a size 6. I\u2019m waiting on a size 8 and hoping that will fit better. I wore them for a few hours to an event and they killed my toes because of how small they were but otherwise surprising comfy!! Zippers didn\u2019t work as well as I thought and the white part got dirty fast but I do love them. I\u2019ll either update this review or make a new one when the size 8 comes but you MUST SIZE UP Update: I got the size 8 and they fit better, I still could do a size 8.5. If zipped up all the way they rub on my ankle bone so I unzipped a tiny bit and they\u2019re perfect. The white trim gets dirty SO fast and the suede black does too with lint and hair sticking. I wouldn\u2019t pay $90.00 for these but they were on sale for $37 so for that price they\u2019re worth it."

I would gladly try for the next half size up but if those don't work as well I'm not paying $11 for shipping and no pair of shoes.  What a disappointment.

The only con I can describe is in the way the pieces of leather are stitched together across the top of the foot.  The seam is rigid and doesn't arc well so it seems wide at that seam.

    "message": "The answer from the seller about the \"vegan leather\" material is misleading: this is an ankle-height rubber rain boot. Thick, heavy rubber. Like your childhood wellies, but even floppier because they are super wide, especially at the ankle. Before I applied an insole, it felt like I was standing and trying to walk wearing a plastic bucket on each foot. That being said, once I had my favorite insoles in they became wearable. I am keeping these for the upcoming rainy months as rainboots I can wear casually, but the fit and material were a complete surprise."

If you're a perfectionist like me with your special shoes, you wont like how dirty the soles get and how fast. Even with a magic eraser cant get all the dirt off. So that sucks but they're super cute if you can keep them clean."

They are super comfortable so I can wear them all day walking around and not have my feet hurting by the end of the day. I typically wear a size 8 (which is what I ordered) and they fit me perfectly. I do have narrow feet where I could see a person with wider feet my having issues (just as a heads up)."

The 8 1/2 were way too big! I ended up selling them to a friend because I hate having to deal with returns. I just got my Size 8 in today and they\u2019re perfect. I have a narrow foot and they fit great. If you have a wide foot I would size up. Overall they\u2019re the cutest shoes and so comfortable!"

I got compliments on them at work, no one could tell they were rain boots. They have a comfy sole, not much arch support but they're soft so no problem wearing them all day, just the couple spots where they rub do get sore."

However,  I have narrow feet and even with thin sox these 8.5 were still a bit snug fitting ...so I suggest going a half size up if you wear thick socks.  Also the zipper part hits the ankle area which can hurt a bit unless your socks cover your ankle. Otherwise,  I like them."

I\u2019ve gotten so many compliments on them. My only disappointment, after only wearing them a few times, I can see a tiny area on the tip of the toes is loosing the fuzz, it looks like grey plastic underneath. I will just need to be careful to not touch anything, I\u2019m not sure how it even happened."

These are great casual shoes that give you a little height!"

I left the zippers slightly unzipped which made them comfortable and also stylish. You really can\u2019t tell you\u2019re in heels but you are a bit taller which for me at 5\u20193\u201d is a huge difference. Love! I also have foot pain and these didn\u2019t hurt my feet! They don\u2019t have much (or any) arch support but had a soft footbed so they still worked well for me."

They are a great alternative to a casual sneaker and i get compliments on them frequently.  Since the sole is about an inch platform, the hidden wedge is pretty low so they are quite easy to wear for extended periods of time, even if standing or walking."

The width is narrow imo they have adjusted and fit better than they first did. I actually couldn't even put my foot in them at first, I had to not wear socks and then spritzed with water and walked inside with them. Still not the most comfortable shoe. Maybe if you have a narrow foot they might be."
