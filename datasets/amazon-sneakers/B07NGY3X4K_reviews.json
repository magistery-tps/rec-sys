My only successes so far have been a couple (expensive) Merrells and (no-support, cheaply made) \"XW\" Easy Spirits.  These have been the first tennis shoes I've been able to get my post-surgical foot into other than a pair of Merrell Moab Flights!  They're just a hair too narrow for full comfort, but being that I got them for about half the price of the Merrells and my foot is still healing a bit, I'm going to keep them and they should fit better in another month or two. If you've been disappointed by way-too-narrow \"wide\" shoes like Asics, New Balance, or Columbia, these would be worth a try.  If you need really wide shoes, try the tennis-shoe height Merrels like Moab Flight or Moab 2.  Those are wider than these in the same size, but the mid-height Merrells seem to run a little more narrow. Other benefits: they look well made, have nice padding around the ankle, they're super lightweight, and they have a very supportive sole (can't be bent in half over the arch like cheaper shoes).  There is a little arch support built in, but I'm replacing the insoles with orthotics for a little more support just with my foot structure. Recommended!"

The biggest thing about my liking these shoes is I have trouble finding anything that is comfortable.  I had Morton's Neuroma surgery, and over a year later, I still have pain in the bottom of my foot.  I need a shoe that provides good support, but is soft on my sore foot.  I couldn't afford 160 to 200 dollar shoes, and that is what a lot of the shoes that are recommended for my condition cost.  So for what I paid for these, and the fact that I got though several airports, and walking to see the sights on our trip, says quite a lot!  I don't know if these are all time, sure fire, all out, shoe for saving my poor foot from hating to walk, but they held up pretty well, and that made me happy that I bought them!"

Since I found this brand that fit well it\u2019s been easier to just hop on Amazon and get a new pair. I\u2019ll probably be going back and getting repeat colors after awhile. I do look for when a pair is less than the usual 59 something. I think these might have been a return because bottoms looked tried on, but hey shoes in the retail store have been too.

I purchased these because of the reviews about how helpful they are for the debilitating affliction.  However, it is important to mention that they are slippery on indoor smooth floor boards. I've walked outside in pouring rain and they haven't been slippery on concrete or asphalt. I would purchase again because of the plantar issue, but am hesitant about these treads on indoor smooth services. The tread looks good so I can only assume the material is the issue."

I also didn't want to break the bank so when I saw these I was apprehensive because the cheapest color choice wouldn't have been my first pick but I figured why not? SUPER lightweight. I do think they are probably on the narrow side but I don't ever buy wide shoes so it works for me. I also am sure that as you wear these they'll give a bit because the front of the shoe is still mostly breathable fabric and not rigid. Will update more as I use them"

When the new pair arrived today, the insoles were very hard, not cushiony. The shoe also seemed to be bigger, roomier than my current pair.  When I matched the 2 pairs side-by-side, the size was the same but the new pair was missing the React2U versafoam insert (see picture).  When I put the old insert in the new shoe, the fit and comfort were perfect.  I am not sure if the React2U versafoam insert was part of a product change and intentionally left out or if the insert was left out in error. If it was an error, I hope the company sends me the correct inserts.  If the product changed, I will not purchase these shoes in the future."

    "message": "This is my third time purchasing this shoe. I'm not a runner, but I have a very active dog and usually walk between 4 and 8 miles a day - these shoes take it like a champ. The first set of pictures are my most recent pair, which I bought in October. With my usual walking habits and how often I wore them, I would estimate they have about 1000 miles on them. As you can see, they are definitely worn down and in need of replacement. I think the usage I get out of them is a great trade-off. I've used them hiking, rafting and in my day-to-day life. The second set of photos is my new pair, which arrived today. I love that they are comfortable from the get-go. It does help to break them in a bit before you take a rocky trail or something, but I comfortably walked 4 miles in them today. They look great and have great support. They're also very breathable, which is nice to minimize sweat. As for sizing, I buy size 8 for these shoes. Usually, I'm a 7.5 or an 8, so if you're deciding between two sizes, I would size up. There's not any wiggle room either. All-in-all, these shoes are really a steal for the price. There are plenty of similar quality shoes out there for $100 or more. These are worth everything they cost!"

They're her absolute favourite and she wears them to school all the time and whenever she has to do a lot of walking. She says her feet don't hurt after a long day. Cushioned but firm at the same time. I absolutely love this brand."

It\u2019s extremely hard feels like you\u2019re walking on concrete.  I have worn them daily for a few days hoping to adjust to the feel. That didn\u2019t help and there is already dents when the heel and the toes are."
