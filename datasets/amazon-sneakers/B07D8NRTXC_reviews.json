People mistake them for converse, I don't care about brands anyway but some people do.  I wear 9.5 and the 10 fit very well.  I did need to add in a set of press-on arches to make them comfortable and that added to the price but I am still satisfied.  I get tons of compliments on them.  I would not wear them for lengthy walking but they are great for running errands etc. Now for the cleaning:  I recommend first of all spraying them with sneaker protector to minimize stains.  I also recommend not wearing them in the mud or when spattering spaghetti sauce :) if you want to keep them clean.  Throwing them in the washing machine totally messed up my white ones so don't do that! I think I had worn them without socks and some dirt from the soles of my feet transferred into the interior of the shoe.  When they became wet, the dirt spread and stained the outside of the shoe.  However, cool thing! I was able to paint them with acrylic paints (directions on line) and now I can wear them again.  You can clean those toe caps with whitening toothpaste, it works amazing!  Thanks for these very affordable, fun, and comfortable shoes!"

    "message": "Initially I was concerned that I may not like these shoes. So many people mentioned the lack of arch support and that the shoe bed is totally flat. However, I came across a reviewer that stated how much she loved these shoes after inserting an \"arch cookie\" - just below the padding in the shoe bed. What the heck. I decided to give them a try. I ordered a pair of size 9 shoes and then searched Amazon for a pair of arch cookies. Upon receiving the shoes, I immediately inserted the arch cookie and walked up and down my hallway. Wow... I love these shoes! I was ready to commit and step out of the house with them on. If you have a high arches like mine, the arch cookie is such a wonderful solution for flat bedded shoes. Now I'm going to order this same shoe in blue and get a couple more arch cookies. RATING: I gave the shoes 4 stars since I had to cough up the money to create a better fitting shoe. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars. They're cute and priced well enough to order them in several colors. I hope this helps anyone out there who is undecided about these cute, retro looking sneakers."

It kills me to say it, but I actually like these better than Converse! Usually Converse are tight along the sides, but these are a bit looser (in a good way) and fit much more comfortably. I ordered the white to try it out, and I already have the yellow pair coming and the sea foam colored ones are sitting in my cart. 10/10."

I don\u2019t do well with flats because of my arch, but I had plenty of room to add both  a shoe cushion and arch support which only made the comfort even better.  If you\u2019re looking for a low cost tennis shoe that\u2019s stylish, these are a great choice.  The only thing that bothered me is that the items were not shipped via Amazon but USPS and with that the box was very damaged and had also been opened.  Not what I expected for an Amazon delivery."

About what you expect from these type of shoes and what it looks like in the pictures.  The quality is fine. I've always avoided shoes like this as an adult because they hurt my feet as a kid, but thought I'd give it a try.  They hurt my heels in the back.  Especially on the right foot where there's a spot that rubs."

I never have to breaker in my Converse; they are comfortable right out of the box.  ZGR\u2019s sneakers are stiffer and less comfortable.  I have wore them with no show socks and without socks and the comfort level compared to Converse is quite noticeable.  My biggest issue is they hit me funny below the ankle and rub the skin.  This is the 4th time I have worn them and the stiff seam is still digging into the skin below the ankle.  I think they would be fine if you wear your sneakers with thicker socks but I don\u2019t want to.  They look good and the soles have good cushion but I wouldn\u2019t buy them again. UPDATE: I wash my Converse sneakers all the time.  I washed these sneakers twice since purchase.  First wash was normal.  Second time I washed them there was pink cardboard in the washing machine.  I thought I forgot something in my pockets until I saw that both inserts popped out in the wash.  There was a layer of pink cardboard between insert and the sole.  It totally got shredded up in the wash.  It peeled off really unevenly."

    "message": "All these positive \"true to size\" reviews are crazy! I usually wear Women's 7.5 in most shoes, 8 in low-top Converse to avoid blisters, and these are closer to a Men's 8. I plan to exchange them, and the look + quality are what I expected so I'm rating them 4 stars, but just be aware you may want to get a couple sizes to try and return the ones that don't fit."

I think they run slightly larger but with Sox they will be perfect\u2026also, I think the more you dirty them up the better they will get!"

These are by far the best Chick Taylor dupes I\u2019ve ever seen. I will be buying my self a couple pairs as well I\u2019ll be getting my daughter a couple pair in white and navy. These are great a great cost effective choice for parents that need to buys shoes for their kids. I get nothing out of this review and I\u2019m picky."
