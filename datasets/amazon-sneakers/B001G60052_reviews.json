    "message": "They're exactly what I was looking for. They're heavy to walk in at first. (But that was what I was searching for, the added weight and sole structure on these makes you use muscles in the back of your thighs and glutes when walking). They're SLIGHTLY loose around the heal. Typically I wear thin socks, so I had to wear slightly thicker socks to keep shoes from sliding up and down on my heel as I walk (again they only slide EVER so SLIGHTLY and I am a bit finicky about shoes. Probably not a problem for most others. Also I tend to have really skinny ankles and feet so this problem may not be relevant if you're feet are normal width) I would not recommend for work that keeps you on your feet standing in place or lifting heavy items all day.  For normal daily use (running errands a few hours, some light gardening, and walking my dog) I found these very comfortable, supportive, and fashionable. Lacing up a little stiff at first but that will change with more use. They came in professional store bought packaging with stuffing in shoes to ensure they keep their shape, which is important to keeping shoes  for a longer period of time.  I am giving these a 4 only because I need to know how long they will actually last. I dont know if I'll have product quality problems with them. I dont think I will, seeing as they seem to be made well and are without visible flaws. Price was fair and shipping was actually faster than anticipated. Eta was this coming Friday, they arrived yesterday. Im So HAPPY with my purchase!"

    "message": "At first unboxing of these shoes they appear bulky and cumbersome, but much to my surprise when you put them on they appear dainty and sooo light!! After reading literally all of the other reviews, I decided to go ahead and purchase a half size up (I would normally wear an 8.5 W and bought a 9 W). For the record, I think I could have worn an 8.5 W but they were also all sold out of that size at the time. The 9 W feels slightly loose when you first put it on, but that is because the way the shoes are laced. Once I took the laces out and replaced them without going through the extra center loops they were much more snug. My favorite part of these shoes is the toe box width and height, there is so much room to ensure comfort after walking great distances. They feel super cushioned which leads me to believe they will have great shock absorption, I bought these shoes for my trip to Italy next week, so after I\u2019ve put them to the test walking all over Rome I will update my review! Update: 11/1/19 These shoes far exceeded my expectations and I\u2019m so happy with my purchase. In Italy I walked approximately 8 miles a day in these shoes and I attribute them to keeping me going. After walking so much I can officially say that the 9W is the appropriate size and I think any smaller would have been uncomfortable on such long walks. The fit is amazing and doesn\u2019t rub or dig into your foot anywhere and the support is superb. Now with almost 70 miles on them they still look and feel amazing. These shoes will be my staple for future trips. Not to mention they are extremely fashionable and I saw several European girls wearing them while I was on my trip. Get these shoes, you won\u2019t be disappointed."

They are comfy and okay for walking. The one thing I don\u2019t like about them is that the part where your ankle is inside the shoe wears out and the foam comes out so you have to replace them. It\u2019s super annoying and it happened badly to my first pair and my boyfriend\u2019s sisters pair and it\u2019s slowly happening to my new pair. To avoid it the best thing to do is tie the laces tight and don\u2019t slip them on; you have to untie the laces and take them off carefully every time or else the friction will build up on the back and the foam will rub off."

I walk at least 6 miles a day so my feet swell up from walking during the day sometimes. Size 8 then became perfect for me. 7.5 will fit well too if I do not walk as much. If you have normal or narrow feet, follow your regular size, do not size up. It came in with an original shoes box, wrapped up with a plastic piece for extra protection. Took it right out of the box, the shoes are not as heavy as I thought. It is chunky which is my favorite style of shoes. It has mild to moderate arch support which I like. It is comfortable to wear for a long time, there was no break in period for me. The quality is pretty good. I work in an auto body shop, been running up and down to work on and check on cars. I do not see any sign of wearing after a month at least. The quality is not premium but in this price, I do not expect it to be excellent anyways.

Definitely not narrow or \u201csquished\u201d by the toe. The shoe just kept slipping. I reordered the wedge version (from an actual retailer) in a 7 1/2 and it is a perfect fit. So, these reviews make me wonder... Also, some have mentioned that they received fakes. I contacted the seller prior asking about that but got no response. Amazon did say they would cover it if it was. So, since y\u2019all got me super paranoid, I watched some YouTube vids on how to tell of their real or fake. I checked the tags,  Stitching, outer sole and inner. Everything seemed on point except for the red stitching of the foot bed (inside). Mine had red stitching whereas I\u2019m the vids, they were white. On the wedges I replaced these with it is white also. Idk if that equals to fake. They seemed legit otherwise."

I love how \"chunky\" the bottoms are, they look really nice even though I wear a size 9 which is bigger than the average women's foot size so sometimes alot of shoes fit me wear or don't look as I imagined, but these seem to flatter them very well in my opinion! They are a must have, you can tell how well they are made."
