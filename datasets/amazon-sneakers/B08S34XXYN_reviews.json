    "message": "I am constantly going through shoes and footwear. I have four dogs and our newest one has an affinity for chewing on my shoes, so between walking 2 mi a day and having a destructive pet I am always looking for inexpensive quality shoes. I have purchased shoes that are similar to these before so I pretty much knew the style. What I like about these is some of the issues I experienced previously have been corrected. My heel doesn\u2019t slide out of the shoes and the inserts stay in place, but I can also take them out and wash them if I need to. Details: Size: I have seen a couple of comments on the size of the shoe. I wear a size 9 in most shoes and that includes going to a retail store and trying some on. With most shoes the size tends to vary slightly depending on the brand. My advice is if you own shoes that are slightly tight on your foot then go a half size up, for instance I have a pair of shoes that are somewhat uncomfortable and they are 8.5, I ordered a size 9 and they fit perfectly. Sole: The sole of the shoe is a thick rubber and provides a \u201cbounce\u201d that makes it absorb enough shock to be comfortable while running. It is half an inch thick to give you an idea of the thickness and the rubber is soft, wear-resistant, and elastic making it suitable not just for running but for all kinds of sports. Insole: The insole of the shoes is soft and the cushioning is comfortable, breathable and lightweight. I noticed that this shoe seems to be better than previous because it is excellent at dampening the shock of your stride and allows for anti-skid performance. From using them I have noticed it can effectively absorb part of the reaction force, and reduce the burden of your foot. The material is a type of woven material that is soft and lightweight, it has a mesh type material that encloses the insole and seems to help with moister absorption. The breathability prevents the shoe from maintaining unwanted smells and if you take care of the shoe odor will not be an issue. Packaging: The shoes come in a canvas type bag that I appreciate because it helps reduce waste on the environment, but the bag is really helpful if you are taking the shoes to the gym in your gym bag. Uses: I am no fashion icon, but I have used these to walk my dogs, workout in the gym, run, play sports as well as wear them to go shopping at the mall. They are aesthetically pleasing whether you are in shorts or pants. I have the peach colored shoes and I love them; they are inexpensive and have a high quality to them. They are perfect for everyday use and if you take care of them, they will last you longer than many name-brands."

These Sneakers are not really supportive, but what do you expect for $40.00. These Sneakers are stylish and lightweight. It's like walking on clouds. I walk a lot and needed a soft Sneaker.

I found they ran a little small in the toe ( I have slightly wider feet) so I returned for a 1/2 size larger. Another review said they were slippery and when I looked at the sole I was worried that would be the case because the sole was very shiny. Not like any rubber sole on a sport shoe I have owned  before.  Because of that I wore them around the house all day on hardwood floors and surprisingly they were not slippery and in fact very comfortable. I suffer from intermittent plantar fasciitis and I had no pain wearing these shoes.  They felt great.  I think they are more comfortable than the more expensive shoes I bought 6 months ago. They appear to be made well.  I like the small pop of color too. Time will tell how they hold up with more strenuous outdoor walking but for now I give them 2 thumbs up for comfort."

I have to supplement with gel inserts for better arch support though. These shoes are absolutely great for minimal walking (like usual day to day walking), but for my workday, they work great for the first half of my shift. Second half, not so much. Probably just my feet being tired and not necessarily the shoe. I like the style, colors, and feel. Would definitely recommend for general walking around. Good product."

Looks wise, they look nice from the side only! When you put them on and you look down on them, they look like old lady shoes to me with a pointy toe. Weird! If you're buying this shoe, order a similar shoe from Sketchers of the same size, and return the pair you like the least.

    "message": "These shoes were very comfortable. After 6 months of occasional wearing I noticed that the bottom of both feet felt wet after walking through a small puddle.  I then took my shoes off and there was a crack in the ball of my foot area of the shoe on both feet.  I just threw the shoes away.  A good price and comfort but they don't last. Bummer."

    "message": "I love how light weight these shoes were.  It was like carrying air.  My only issue was that the outer areas on the sole part inside the shoe were really hard and hurt my feet.  I tried to break it in and wear it for a bit to see if maybe it was just me being a sensitive sally, but even after a week of wearing it every day, my feet were really sore.  Overall great concept, and super lightweight, but not very comfortable."
