He has a very high arch, so the top strap just barely fastens. Also the shoe shape is slightly smaller across the instep. He does like them and felt they were really comfortable from the beginning, with no time needed to break them in. He would get them again but prefers the previous design of the shoes for their longer strap and roomier instep."

I do a lot of walking so I know that I can wear out a shoe pretty quickly. So to address the issue I alternate between pairs of New Balance and Rockforts. Dr. Scholls was the least comfortable but still acceptable. The others were more comfortable. I was able to make the Dr. Scholls' pair more comfortable by adding... you guessed it, a Dr. Scholl's pad!!! So walking outside was not so bad. My issue has to do with a completely unforseen problem. This shoe in a house with carpeting produces more static electricity than anything I have ever worn. I am literally shocked almost every time I wear it regardless of the weather. If this energy could be captured I could charge my cell phone and other small electronics. And yes it occurs with or without the insoles. So I relegated it to only outside use. But one more thing that I have to add is that the soles do appear to deteriorate far quicker than the other brands that I use. I have many shoes wear out from the bottom center but this shoe actually is showing a crack at the bottom center."

If money is no object, keep buying these new several times a year and you will enjoy them.

I have only been using these shoes for a week now, so the jury is still out on durability, but, they are fairly comfortable with the gel pads and seem very light, if one needs to move fast. 3 MONTHS LATER.  I am still content with these shoes, but as I expected they do wear fast, but are also faster in getting to the pickle ball and seem to walk a lot quieter in the house, than my previous heavier Reebok DMX walkers. The Reebok will last longer, but are no longer available.  I will be ordering 2 more pairs of DR Scholl's velcro shoes, because of the softer, quieter walk, but mostly for getting around on the court.  I would like to see a 9.5 double E to triple E width, but that doesn't seem to be available, so I have to order a half size larger double E , for the right width, for me.  On the order form, it shows EE width..When the shoes were received, it shows size 10 W..is EE even available..?"

You can't go wrong with these, they are made of quality materials, well put together, the jell inserts are amazing for anyone on their feet all day.
