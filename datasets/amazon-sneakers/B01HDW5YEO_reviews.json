They are very lightweight.  I wear them to the gym for weight training but do not think they are appropriate for running.  The bottom rubber sole seems a bit too soft and small rocks like to jam and get stuck.  Other than that, I really like this sneaker.  The color of the material is unique, sort of a blend between gray and silver with black trim.  I think they look great and they also look very nice to wear with jeans.

I wore them for the first time today on a 4 mile walk and they were light  and flexible just like the 8. They fit as expected im a 9.5 and bought 9.5. However I do tend to wear thicker socks and the 8 was definitely a more of a snug fit than these. I don't like that the tongue is on the thicker end and is sewed to the base and not the sides, to get it flat after putting on takes a little finesse. However I do like that I can tighten around my ankles by tightening the lace due to the top lace looks are linked to the piece round the back of the shoe."

In my case, these shoes hurt the top of my right foot which has a taller arch than my left. I ended up lacing the shoes differently to accommodate for the extra space that I needed on top and then there was none of that uncomfortable pressure on the top of my foot. My only other problem was that the shoes are more narrow than I expected. Not uncomfortably narrow, just narrow enough that makes me think that the sides will wear quicker."

The tongue is really long 3. The lace holes are tight together and they sit around the middle of the top of your foot This combination makes the tongue stick straight up and it pushes the laces together into an overlapping clump on the top of your foot. Literally all the crossed laces are a clump of what looks like tangled laces. As soon as you take the shoe off everything looks normal again. Because the laces bunch up together into the middle of the top of your foot, nothing is holding the tongue down, so it sticks straight up and forward. You now have a funky looking shoe that has no support and it hurts because of this clump pressing into the top of the foot. I spent 3-5 minutes messing with it and trying to fix them with no luck. Hindsight, I should have taken a picture to show this weird set up."

They have no support at all, they squish down as you are trying to put your foot into them, and the tongue is humongous and it sticks way up which looks ridiculous.  I can't believe Nike made this shoe.  I am so disappointed!  I have literally thrown them away and am buying another style."

I even had three other people try them on and they both experienced the same thing. That said, they are very light, and the price point is good, so I\u2019m going to just see if I can stretch them out."
