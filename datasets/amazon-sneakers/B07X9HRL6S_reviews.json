It gives me great support and is very comfortable.  I am writing this review about 2 months out because I wanted to make sure it was a lasting product.  I can say that the traction on the bottom of the shoe is still like new.  I like these so much I am buying another pair."

Like the fact they're made of leather. Only negative I have is that the laces are half the width of any shoe I have and very light weight -- not sure if they will last for any period of time. I will be replacing them."

They\u2019re also quite stylish and can go with any outfit:) I tried working out in them and since I get on the floor to workout sometimes, I noticed that they got a bit wrinkly if you bend at the toes\u2026so if you don\u2019t want that, don\u2019t workout in them! Besides that, I would recommend these shoes :)"

I have been wearing them for almost a month now and I have to say these are the most comfortable shoes I have. The very first thing I did and always do when I purchase a new pair of shoes is buy new insoles and remove the cheap ones that are in them. I started out wearing them for just a few hours a day and then increase until I\u2019m satisfied, I haven\u2019t had any issues at all no blisters or sore feet actually I don\u2019t want to take them off at all they feel just like my slippers do very comfortable. You don\u2019t find any sneakers at all today that have any leather on them at all maybe vegan,  but not real leather. These shoes are just a perfect fit and very comfortable I will purchase them again in another color I highly recommend them you will love them!"

Some of the New Balance, like many other shoes today, are made to stretch and tear so you have to spend more money to replace them. It used to be that either you outgrew a shoe (if you were a kid) or, if an adult, that the support and tread would be the reason it wore out and needed replacing. These days shoes have a kind of fabric on them that stretches but also tears. This one has a kind of fabric but doesn't tear. I find them very comfy and give me support--since I'm overweight that's important."

The inside of the foot tilts downward while the outside tilts upward. This will cause knee, hip and back problems even with an insert. If an insert is used you'll have to cut off the outside half and use the inside half. How does a company like New Balance make sneakers like this? They used to be a go-to for those with foot problems. It's better to find a New Balance store and actually try them on. I almost thinking that these aren't actual New Balance sneakers because they are terribly made."

For some reason shoe was too small. I ordered an 8 wide.  They seem to be ok. Just a smidge too big. If anyone knows a good walking shoe that I can get a wide and the ankle area is cut low.

Because of this, I knew I could not just order a Nike cross trainer because the support would be equivalent to a training bra. I needed a New Balance shoe. I needed THIS New Balance shoe. I ordered these knowing I would love them. I set the bar so high, anything less than would have morphed the Karen right out of me. And you know what? These shoes DELIVERED. I love them so much I\u2019m going to give them names. I will wear these as my slippers. I will wear these as my walking shoe. I will wear these on my wedding day if I don\u2019t spill too much spaghetti on them. I am a 7.5 and they fit as a 7.5 should. I have average sized feet and the width of the shoe is fab. If you\u2019re looking for something you can wear all day / night here\u2019s your sign."
