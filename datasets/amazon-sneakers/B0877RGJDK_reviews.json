    "message": "This is a good looking sneaker and the sole is actual rubber which is hard to find these days. The fit however is a little peculiar. The vamp, the part right below the bottom of the laces, is oddly roomy. The toe box isn't so it fits good from the heel through the laces, is too roomy for about an inch or two then fits well again. It would definitely end up creating a crease across that part of the sneaker. It wasn't a fit I felt I would ever NOT notice so I returned them. A bit disappointed  because they do look good and had some decent support."

I have used them three times for Zumba sessions and they have performed perfectly. However, I think they do not have enough support to withstand the impact of running and even power walking. Still, great shoes for light walking, Zumba-like classes and just being around on your feet."
