I wear a size 12 in womens and hoped the size 11 would be big enough since it is the biggest they come in.  I would say that they do run about a half-size large because I was able to put my foot in them.  Unfortunately my toes were right up against the end of the shoe and so there is no way I would be able to walk in them.  While I had them on, they did feel a bit narrow around the ball of the foot.  I had on a very thin pair of no-show socks with them so if I had thicker socks they would have been even tighter on both length and width.  Otherwise, these shoes look great, very nice red color, the white was white.  Definitely could pass for a Converse! Those are the breaks for me, I have no choice but to send them back."

Even though I have a narrow feet, my pinky toe hurts when I wear Converse but this shoes feels much better and it doesn't bother my toe. And the color looks great. Looks like Converse without an brand name tag. Love it."

I can say they are super cute and wearing for the little time I did they were very comfy. Will update once I wear them to a ball game as intended with the purchase. Update # 1 -- 8/10/22: wore them for about 4 hours and standing on feet most of these hours. They were comfortable and NOT like Converse where they hurt by the sides of big and little toes. Still happy with purchase. . . . One more Update coming after 8/13/22"

I have tried several knock offs and they are always too narrow in the toes. These run a hair longer than my Converse but that allows me to have enough toe room plus room for a full insert. They look great and I love the rich red color. It isn\u2019t orangish like other reds are. Only complaints I have: one of the shoe laces looked like it had a run and fray in it. Not overly noticeable but I noticed it. The toe cap one of the shoes has a slight bubble. It isn\u2019t overly noticeable and I can live with these flaws for the price. Depending on how well these wear, I may be purchasing more colors!"

I saw these on sale and grabbed them hoping for the best and was pleasantly surprised. I was a worried when I saw the packaging(picture) but they were not damaged or worn.  The bottoms of the shoes are kind of sticky but I'm sure that goes away with use. Fits as these shoes should but it feels a little snug towards the tips of my toes. I typically wear anywhere between a 10 to 11 size shoe depending on the type and these fit well as a 10. Pretty comfortable for the price and surprised there is a bit of an arch in the shoe, though not much.  I have not been able to test extended wear yet but if anything crazy happens will update post. Thinking of buying another color if all goes well!"

    "message": "These shoes are absolutely perfect! They feel better that name brand, great because I care more about the style that I care about paying extra money for the opportunity to advertise a company or brand for free. But the other thing I wanted to share is that because there are no half sizes, and I wear a 6 1/2, I debated over ordering the 6 or 7. I decided on the 6, and it fits exactly like a 6 1/2!!! So pleased \ud83d\ude00 They appear to have good support and they are so comfortable!"

    "message": "These are nice sneaks, but I don't believe that they're good for people who have flat feet, and mine are really flat. So, sadly, I had to return them, for they really hurt my feet. I wore them out shopping, and I couldn't wait to get home and take them off. I'm not faulting the sneaker, or the seller, it's just that these sneaks just weren't for me. I wish that they had worked out, for I had wanted to buy these sneaks in several other colors. Please don't let my review deter others from buying this sneaker, for it's well made, with a nice thick sole; it just wasn't the right sneak for me, so all of the ratings are about my feet in the sneaks. I'm sure that others will have a different, more positive experience with them, so please give them a try."
