So I stepped on the back of the shoes out of frustration and that seemed to loosen up the fit! Now they fit perfectly! The shoe feels like it pushes back on your foot which is nice (kinda bouncy). The rubber sole seems to be coming apart but nothing a little gorilla glue can\u2019t fix. (I\u2019ve only had these for like 3 months now and I don\u2019t walk much in them). Another con would be that they\u2019re easily stained, but that\u2019s every white shoe.."

I always wear a size 7 in Steve Madden, and basically every other shoe I own, so when these came I did not even try them on at first because I've never had a sizing issue before. The day I ended up wearing them for the first time they were not too big in the length, just the width. I believe due to the shoe having a platform sole, it causes the shoe to fit slightly snug. I personally ordered another very similar type of shoe from Steve Madden that fit more comfortably, but I still LOVE these and think they are adorable with the right outfit! Be careful not to get them dirty though, because they are made of canvas, not leather & make sure to order a 1/2 size up if you do not like your sneakers to fit on the small side."

I was so disappointed cause they are super cute and I love the platform, but they are extremely narrow and stiff and have no cushion at all. After a day of wearing them at work my feet had blisters and were so so sore. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone."

    "message": "My second try,  slightly different style, same issue.  The shoes are too narrow at the toe, while at the same time slipping off my heal.  I didn't know whether to give a star for too small or too large as BOTH are a problem at the same time.  The quality seems nice, but No more Steve Madden shoes for me.  I don't have this problem with other name brands....ever!"

There\u2019s no support and the bottom is so heavy and the cloth is flimsy so it\u2019s easy for the foot and ankle to roll in them. They are cute if you\u2019re just wearing them for pictures. Otherwise they are impractical"

    "message": "I bought these shoes for my bachelorette party in Nashville. Wore them to walk to brunch and I literally had to switch shoes with another one of my bridesmaids because my feet were destroyed (huge blisters on heel and toe and started bleeding). My bridesmaid dresses said she would switch shoes with me because she\u2019s used to that and at least we could make it to the restaurant. By the time we made there her feet were the same as mine. We had to uber the rest of the trip because we were limping and slow following. Really disappointed. Most of my shoes are Steve Madden because the style and comfort are amazing but these were a whole different experience"

They are just over all super cheaply made. Which is understandable for the price but I definitely thought I\u2019d get more than one wear out of them before they started falling apart"
