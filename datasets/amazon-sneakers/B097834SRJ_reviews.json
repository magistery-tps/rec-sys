Shoes are super lightweight, they almost remind of a water shoe\u2026 I would definitely consider getting a pair to use in the creek/out adventuring. Size wise I\u2019m normally an 8.5 in womens running shoes so I ordered a mens 7. They are fine for walking, I think if I were going to use them to work out I might go for a 7.5 in mens just so I had a little extra space from the front of the shoe\u2026 the shoe is fairly roomy, I have a wide foot so I can manage, wouldn\u2019t get them if you have a very narrow foot. Overall happy with the purchase."

There are subtle differences such as the loop at the heal being different sized. I would say these run about a half size small, but the fabric stretches, if you like compression socks, you'll like these. I've worn these for a month or so now, and these are the lightest weight, most cushioned sole sneakers I've ever owned.  Almost like wearing slippers, and I really enjoy them."

    "message": "I have a 8.5/9.0 size shoe, depending on the manufacturer. I purchased these exclusively for work, on a slippery (paper dust) concrete floor and a forklift. The main con here is there is NO size 9.0, only 8.5 or 9.5. I think this is odd, but I am sure there is some reason for it. Nonetheless, I ordered the 9.5 in black. I was expecting it to be a little large. However, this shoe fits me perfectly. Thus my reasoning that, for me, these run small. These stretch. They are not constrictive. I despise tight constricting shoes since they usually hurt my feet. I also hate shoes that are too big as they tend to make me trip (I am already uncoordinated). They have a softer rubber/plastic'y sole. I dont know the material, other than \"Phylon\". I have only worn for two weeks and they are comfortable.  I do feel their flexibility. These shoes are not a stiff shoe. For me, that is a plus. However, non slip they are not. In defense, I have not experienced any shoe that is non slip on the floor at my work. The smooth concrete floor is often covered in a finite paper dust. This makes it slippery and no shoe can stand up to my lack of coordination. My biggest like is they are very breathable. My feet sweat! During the hot days, I need my feet to breathe. These do that quite well. Also, I enjoy and actual solid sole. Some other \"fancy\" shoes I purchased were comfortable, but they had a very thin tread and wore out quickly. They did not last long. Time will tell if these last long. Another plus for these shoes, is there is very little text on the shoe. The only text is on the tongue of the shoe. They are also easy to put on, almost like a slip on shoe that does not fall off. Out of the box (and still now) there are no defects. It appears to be well put together. If I can get 8 months use out of these, I will be absolutely buying again."

The bottom of the sole is beginning to show signs of cracks in the rubber. This is quite alarming. I am very disappointed because other than that, these are so comfortable and I love them but the quality is just rubbish."

For some reason the laces are crazy long, I had to cut almost 10\" off and took a lighter to the ends to seal them so they didn't drag.  Great for walking and just wearing."
