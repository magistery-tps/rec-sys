But if your day requires any real walking, these are not your shoe.  I loved initially that they seemed to have arch support, but there is no cushion to that support.  I wore to the airport and within a few minutes of walking I regretted not wearing a more sturdy shoe and by the time I got through the airport and at my hotel, I was searching out a place to get some true support.  Cute and fashionable, but not overly practical and missing what we really need from shoes, support."

I noticed not all colors and patterns were available all the time so if I loved a color, I shopped for it, and in the case of these white ones, I wanted a spare.  I live in a wet climate and white doesn\u2019t stay white for long.  Even if they are washable, they never end up the same.  I love these comfy little slip on shoes, and I even get compliments on them all time... but they aren\u2019t cheap (relatively speaking) so I watch for sales.  I just grabbed these white ones for a song through the Amazon Warehouse Deals!  I have had mixed results from the warehouse offerings, so your mileage may vary, but my white ones were in perfect condition (as far as I can tell) and even came in the original box with the tissue paper etc still in the shoes.  I am thrilled with this purchase!"

My daughter needed another pair of casual sneakers, but she already has a ton with neon colors, so I wanted something neutral. The shimmery gold and silver is adorable. And the little hints of rose gold on the metal eyelets and labels adds a cute touch. I always size up a half or whole size with these, for a perfect fit. With the first few wears, they can be tougher to get on, but once they're broken in, they're very easy to slip on and off. The memory foam foot bed keeps your feet cozy, and the lightweight, (yet quality) construction makes it feel like you're walking on air. Can't recommend enough to everyone! Buy these!"

I am already working on my 4th pair over two years (two pairs i bought elsewhere).  I do not wear everyday, maybe one to two times a week.  I also do not wear when I'm out in the grass or doing anything that may cause them to get overly dirty.  They get holes very easy in the toes and are coming apart at the sole.  Its extremely frustrating because i do really like the Roxy brand and especially the style and comfort of the shoe. Unfortunately this will most likely be my last pair....i know, it took me a bit to learn."

    "message": "I bought two pairs, anthracite black and white. I really wanted minimalist shoes and these really fit that look. They're very soft and pliable. The soles get dirty easily but I don't care since they're shoes. The insoles slip out all the time and it's a bit annoying. I have very narrow, slim, tiny size 5 feet. I'm like 5 feet and 95 lbs and I'm an adult so I thought I'd go for my normal size 5 but I wanted to wear socks with these so I bought a size 5.5 based off of the reviews. Good lord am I glad I did. As small as my feet are, these shoes are still tight. I can wear them with ballet socks but any other socks won't fit. My toes hit the edge of the toe box, with and without socks, and I had my nails trimmed down. Generally I wear a lot of heels and sandals so I normally have longer toenails but I would never be able to wear these shoes unless I trim them. So there's that. Anyhow I have yet to smell anything weird from them after several wears without socks (which doesn't make them any more comfortable or fit any better). The issues I have with them would be that the elastic inside them leave deep indents in my skin and itch uncomfortably and the edges of the mouth also leave imprints on my skin after I take them off. I kinda wish I bought a size 6 because the white ones cut into the back of my ankle, but the black ones don't. As far as how they look though, the fabric looks very clean and new. Even though the anthracite design is distressed the laces are very white and my white pair is very clean overall. I like them since they serve their purpose. Mostly gonna wear my heels and sandals though. These are a little flat and will make my feet hurt a bit after hours of wear (from the tightness not the flatness)."

These are hands down the most comfy shoes I've ever owned. I ordered a 5.5, im usually a 5-5.5 with 6s being giant in everything except for Toms. The 5.5 does fit and im keeping them,, but a bit more snug than preferred and def. no room for socks (though these are catered to not wearing with socks, the lining is so soft and dreamy.) Already ordered another color in a half size up and will be ordering a pair for my toddler (found them in little sizes too!) If you want to wear socks with them on the reg I would recommend ordering a full size up, no socks a half size should do perfectly. Foam cushioning and flexible sole. More comfortable than being barefoot... UPDATE: I managed to drip rust water on one of these shoes (off white) it took some abrasive cleaners and rough scrubbers to get out. I was concerned over damage to the threading and thin fabric but after air drying for a few days they still look great! For those of you wondering how easy they are to keep clean or how they hold up, photos are taken after rust drippage scrubbing. The sage is a size 6, yes they are near grey with a hint of green. The size 5.5 felt very tight at first but wore in quickly. The size 6 is comfortable initially but without socks slips off the back. I hold onto the idea that your normal size is great for no socks and half size up with socks. Future purchases (there will be more because I love them) I will stick with the 5.5."

    "message": "These shoes are zero-drop barefoot shoes. This means your heel is at the same level as your toes. Roxy doesn\u2019t market them as minimalist but if you want to strengthen your ankles, have a toe box that allow your toes to expand naturally and want to feel the ground, buy them. Those that are claiming the ground is hard are right. It\u2019s been hard for a long time!  Once your ankles become stronger and your balance returns to how millions of years of nature intended it to be it won\u2019t feel hard anymore. Your old padded shoes will start to feel uncomfortable. Other shoes surround the foot with unnecessary padding and the backs are higher than the fronts. That puts strain on your legs, toes and feet.  You can\u2019t feel the ground and can easily twist snd strain your ankles. My other barefoot shoes have cost way into the hundreds of dollars each. These are nowhere near that and will last with some card. The Roxy Shoe can be washed. I use individual delicate laundry bags. A little Clorox wipe on the rubber makes it look like new again. They aren\u2019t advertised as zero drop barefoot but they are. I have no more hip, knee, shin  or foot pain. No more neck pain from walking and standing in an unnatural position. My calf muscles aren\u2019t strained. I have high arches, no longer need padding and it\u2019s no longer a problem.  It didn\u2019t happen overnight, it will take a few weeks to acclimate. These aren\u2019t official barefoot shoes, but a great place to start if you want to move towards a healthier lifestyle."

    "message": "ADDENDUM: I changed my rating from 5 to 3 stars. I've had these now for about 2 months. I loved them at the start, and I still WANT to love them (overall they are quite comfy), but there is one feature that is driving me crazy. They have nice foam-y feeling inserts lined with cloth, but for some strange reason the inserts aren't actually attached in any way to the shoe. This means that if your feet sweat AT ALL, when you go to take the shoes off the inserts stick to your foot and come part way out with your foot. Every. Single. Time. I find myself having to shove the inserts back in with each use. And over time they start to get bunched up even when I try to flatten them back down. Maybe mine were defective? Were the inserts supposed to be attached in some way? Most inserts I have used in the past are harder material and heavier, so they don't slide around as easily in the shoe. For those, not attaching them works. But since these are light, foam/cloth inserts, they have no weight to them and get pulled out VERY easily. Sadly, because of this, I don't think I'll be buying these again... ORIGINAL REVIEW: I was looking for something I could slip on to walk the dog, run errands, etc. Easy on, easy off, comfortable. I wasn't expecting to get anything that would hold up to running or exercising. This definitely fits the bill. I will say, the first pair I got had a hardened glob of glue near the opening that rubbed against my ankle and was very uncomfortable, but it looks like just a manufacturing defect. I didn't take a star off for that, as those kinds of things just happen. I went ahead and returned those and got another pair. Glad I did - the new set is perfect and SUPER comfortable. I love that they have a little foam insert, makes them that much nicer to wear. I read other reviews stating that they run a little small, so I ordered up a half size (from 8.5 to 9) and am glad I did. Great buy. Will see how these hold up, but assuming they last a decent amount of time, I'll probably be ordering more!"

No eyelet breathing holes so they get sweaty and hot, fabric is already wearing on seams on the side, they feel a half size smaller than all my other Roxys.  They look like they have arch support from the picture but the inside is totally flat."

    "message": "I bought these knowing that they would have no arch support, which is fine bc I walk around the house barefoot and wear flip flops out (I live in San Diego). I love these shoes.  I have big feet and I have a bunion on my left foot, plus after having 3 kids, my foot became wider.  Even with that, they are still comfy, in my opinion. The only thing that bothered me is that they are a SMIDGE smaller than the white ones.  I bought rhe black and white ones at the same time.  I dont know if it happens to just be this pair, or maybe my white ones are a SMIDGE bigger?? Anyhow, it's not uncomfortable, so it doesnt bother me.  After reading reviews, it looks like they'll stretch out anyway. Also, I'd size up 1/2 size if you dont wear socks and are ok with a snug fit.  Or, 1 whole size if you wear socks and need a little bit more room. I normally wear 8.5 (but 9 in Nike's bc they run small), but ordered 9.5 with the bayshores."

    "message": "A couple years ago I got similar shoes from JCPenney. They wore out, so I decided to pay a little more for these shoes and I am in love! These Roxys are true quality. The memory adds a wonderful layer of cushiness and the sole is adequately thick-- the shoes are extremely comfortable without being flimsy. I got the heathered gray because it reminds me of cozy sweats, and the color goes with everything. I'm so glad I listened to all the other reviewers who said to size up, because they definitely run small. I am a solid 6 1/2-- I very rarely wear a 7, and I ordered these in 7 based on the review. They fit perfectly, but only without socks (which aren't necessary for these shoes since the lining is terrycloth). I think I would able to wear super thin socks with them, but definitely not normal or thick socks. So they definitely run at least 1/2 size small."

    "message": "Really nice material.. Ordered the light gray sneakers/size 7 for my daughter..(11 yrs old).. But they were too small.  She has a wide foot.. However..by the looks of them.. I think they have a stretchability..and some give. I believe that because shoe is made of a cotton thick sweathirty looking material.  But she said \"too small\".  That is my review. Oh..She also said the shoe made her \"foot look weird\".. I didn't think so.  Anyhow..I don't like sneaker reviews. They are sooo mixed. I begin to wonder if the stitching on any given pair of shoe varies? I understand a brand of shoe will run larger and another brand smaller. However, when you have your specific foot measurement..and  you go by the fitting chart for the particular brand..and you get the sneaker..yet still not fitting?  That leads me to think with soo many mixed reviews...The shoes may not be accurately sewn at manufacturing place? I have purchased 7 different brands/pairs of sneakers from Amazon.  I have had luck a few times. The cheaper slip on sneakers(under 25.00)..have been good for both my daughter and myself..  It is really hard to find a wide \"specification\".  Even when I type in \"women's wide sized sneakers\". I don't see specially categorized sneakers for \"wide foot\".  What shows up, (Amazon prime filter).. A few ugly choices.. Or they'll say \"plus sized\"."

    "message": "I love Roxy's Bayshore shoes because they are soft and conform to my feet better than other brands. I can't stand those \"platform\" sneakers that feel like walking on boxed pillows, as I always twist my ankles and can't feel anything I walk on (no, that's not a good thing, might as well get yourself a hoverboard and use that to get around everywhere). Anyways, so the Bayshoeres are softest and most comfortable shoes to wear without paying crazy money for the pricey minimalist shoes. Of course these aren't perfect, the width is still narrow and shape doesn't exactly match a natural foot shape, however, it's the best of \"cheaper popular brands\" out there. I usually wear 6.5, in Bayshores I am 7.5. They do get more comfortable as you break them in. These dark gray ones in particular seem thicker and so a bit more snug than I am used to. I still like them and prefer them over so many other brands."

    "message": "These shoes are the best easy slip on, cute, everyday comfort shoe I\u2019ve been wanting for years! Size up!!!!!!!!!!! These run small!!!!!! I wore my sisters pair when walking all day in Boston in the rain and my feet never hurt. The best part was when we got back to the abnb I was able to throw them in the washer and dryer without them changing their shape or shrinking the fabric. I originally ordered a pair through Roxy and had a horrible experience. Their customer service was not helpful and he couldn\u2019t change my order even though I called to change size the same day. It took weeks to process to ship. It then took weeks to receive from California to Maine and weeks to send back. And I still haven\u2019t received my phone call back or my refund and it\u2019s been over a month now. I paid the regular price here but I received them fast and amazon is always awesome about cancelling if you accidentally order the wrong size and they\u2019re great about returns. All that being said I absolutely LOVE these shoes but I would beware before buying  directly from Roxy."

    "message": "First off, I love these shoes! They are so cute, flexible and soft. FYI - They do not have any arch support and the sole is pretty thin, which I expected. Second off, despite my comments regarding the sizing, I'm still giving 5 stars because I love them! Anyway, I wear a size 8.5 in just about every shoe brand (Skechers, Asics, New Balance, Keds, Saucony to name a few). For Nike I wear a ladies size 9 since they run small and for Converse I wear a ladies size 8 since they run big. After reading the reviews, I ordered a size 9. I tried them on with my no-show socks and they were too small. My toes were hitting the end of them. I wore them around the house and the tips of my toes actually hurt from touching the end! I think they would've been too small without socks too, but I didn't try them without socks. I returned them for a size 9.5 and they fit perfect, just like a regular 8.5 would! I would've never guessed I needed a size 9.5! I will be ordering more of these now that I'm positive what size I need. I uploaded some photos of the shoes alone and in comparison to a ladies Skechers Go Walk size 8.5, ladies Keds size 8.5 and ladies Converse size 8. They were the same exact size!"

    "message": "I love ROXY's!  I have the white in a size 8 and I wear them all the time.  So, I wanted the black (meaning the heather looking black).  I ask my daughter to get them for me for Christmas.  So she ordered an 8 on EBAY and they were beyond SMALL.  They do not fit anything like the white ones.  The EBAY seller wanted 13 dollars to ship them back, so  no way, so I sold them on FB Marketplace and put the money to buying these on Amazon.  I made sure to order a half size up and they fit beautifully and I love them.  So the moral of the story is that, I have NO IDEA WHY THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN SIZING WITH THE DIFFERENT COLORS, BUT THERE IS!  Do NOT ORDER YOUR USUAL SIZE IF YOU ARE GETTING THE BLACK.  Be sure to order a half size larger and you'll be so HAPPY!  Oh.....yes, I love the way that the back of the shoe is stretchy so that it fits your ankle so well, and the logo on the back of every Roxy shoe is so cute."

These are a bit pricier than what I normally spend for these type of sneakers, BUT I wear my other ones so often, so I thought I'd splurge a bit. I got these in the pink color, i love love love them. Exactly what I ordered and came in great condition.. however... THEY RUN SOOOO SMALL . LIKE WHAT? I am normally a 8.5 in sneakers. Once in a while I'm a 8, but I usually go with 8.5 with the majority of my sneakers and they're perfect with socks.. I read the reviews and went with a half size up and got a 9. These bad boys arrived and I slipped them on and low and behold... my feet barely fit in them. My toes were squished up against the front and they were almost painfully tight. So... I returned these and ordered a 9.5 and crossing my fingers they will fit well. So, ladies.... GO A WHOLE SIZE UP. SERIOUSLY. A WHOLEEEEE DANG SIZE."

When I got it in it was like a child's 6 so I sent those back and ordered a size 8 and they fit perfectly so I don't know how these other women are saying it fits true to size because it didn't. I love them though! They have become my everyday shoe. They are easy to put on and take off. The insert is loose at the top of the shoe but is firmly in place everywhere else. There not a whole lot of padding but there is some. Overall I'd suggest buying a size bigger than you normally wear. Also don't wear regular socks otherwise the insert will come out when you take your foot out. Instead get some socks for flats. Thin and breathable that way your feet won't slide the inserts out."

I am a US 8 or 8.5 depending on the style of shoe but with these I order a 9 because they run small. I love the arch support and memory foam. I've seen some other brands with similar styles but for some reason I like Roxy's more. They're easy on my feet that lack arch. Pros: comfy, effortless, goes with everything, cute, memory foam is like walking on soft pillows Cons: wear and tear faster than most types of shoes because they're made of softer materials, memory foam does not last me longer than a few weeks."
