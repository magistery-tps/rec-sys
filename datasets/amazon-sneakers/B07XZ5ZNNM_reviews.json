I have very wide feet and have a pretty hard time finding comfortable shoes that are wide enough without being too long. In this case, I ordered a size 10 which I would normally wear in American sizes. These sneakers are just a tad long, but I can live with it. I ordered the off white/cream color. They rival my normal go-to brand (New Balance) for style and comfort. As soon as I finish this review I will probably order another color in a half size smaller. We'll see how they hold up over time."

I am currently 39 weeks pregnant and they were one of the only shoes I was able to wear during my pregnancy because my feet would swell in all of my other tennis shoes. I am actually about to buy another pair in a different color. I usually wear them without socks, but can be worn with low cut."

Usually size 7.5s are too large (my heels tend to lift out of the shoe), so I was surprised that this fit so snugly. Other than that, the shoe is very comfortable and super light in weight. If it stretches out even the smallest amount, the fit may be fine. BTW, I am wearing the shoes with compression hose only, not even average weight socks."

If you are looking for a great shoes, perfect fit in a vast array of colors and styles you came to the right place.  I just ordered my 3rd pair,  I have used the same pair for over a year and they look and feel barely worn. Oh and a big plus they wash up well in my washing machine.

The only thing I would change is for the sole not to wrap up the front of the toe, it makes the shoe almost too short for me. I tied the shoe laces snuggly, this holds my feet to the back of the shoe and keeps the shoes from hurting my toes. My big toes were bumping against the piece of sole in the front.

    "message": "I've been experiencing some foot discomfort recently due to ongoing back issues.  Unfortunately, I literally am walking different....a shifting of weight, a now different gait - all a compensation for pain.  I was looking for a lightweight, washable, supportive shoe that could be worn indoors.  I live in Florida so didn't need a \"warm\" shoe.  Well.....found it!!!  I'm really, really pleased with this walking tennis shoe.  It is wonderful.  Lightweight, easy to put on, supportive and most of all just plain comfortable.  My feet are not hot and sweaty but simply encased with breathable material that gives no matter what position my foot is in.  Although the back issues are a forever thing my feet are noticeably feeling better too!!"
