Cheaper no-name shoes we recently bought my Son are already starting to have problems with the velcro.  These Pumas have a long strip of velcro, not just at the ends of the straps.  This gives a larger surface area to ensure the straps stay tight.  The rubber on the soles also provides great traction for climbing features at playgrounds.  We have a metal spiral-around-a-pole climbing feature nearby that my Son's other (new) shoes would slip on.  These Pumas grip well and my Son loves that he can climb without needing me to help stabilize his feet."

Other than Puma, my son wears Nike, Adidas, and Sketchers. I noticed the cm length trends smaller per shoe size in Puma than the other brands I listed. It serves a buyer well to GO UP a half of a size. Otherwise, great buy again!"

I have actually washed these and though you can totally toss them in the washer and let them air dry...they do not wash well to remove stains.  Ours are basically grey and I'm normally really good at taking stains out, but not these...  I'm also highly disappointed in the fact that the stitching has already started to come out.  Normally with a pair of shoes like the Surprize brand...it takes a year of wearing for things to get that far.  For the price, I should have just flat out bought genuine Stride Rite shoes.  My daughter has a wider foot and these DO fit but the toe box isn't as wide as it should be if your kid has a wider foot."
