It's kind of amazing how I got the right size. to me the shoes looks beautiful and can be integrated with any fit. The quality is perfect, no excess glue on the sides, no loose strings and the shoes didn't get squashed in the box. as it turned out these shoes are kind of trendy at the moment, many female relatives asked me to get them the same shoes from the US. so it's safe to assume that this would make a good gift to any girl."

I typically get low tops and wear a size 7.5 wide or 8 US women size. I went with the 8 and kept it only because I didn\u2019t want the hassle of returning them and reordering. When I got the shoes and box were all smashed and the shoes were already scuffed and dirty. So if you are a stickler about your shoes being perfect upon arrival you may be disappointed. Luckily, I got these to kick around in so it wasn\u2019t a big deal."
