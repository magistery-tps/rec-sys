At first I felt like they made me 3 inches taller lol but they supported my feet all day at work, and were comfortable. I will probably buy another pair soon so I can have a back up. The price is reasonable as well. I go through shoes so it's great to find a deal. I recommend them for standing on your feet all day!!!"

    "message": "I bought these shoes 9/2020. They were fantastically comfortable and very lightweight. I wore them to throw on to run errands (daily for about 1-3 hours) which means mostly used on concrete surfaces. The sole started to degrade after 12 months with a couple cracks along the ball of the foot. 7 more months of the same amount of use and the sole appears to be made of foam under the thinnest rubber coating. My feet now get wet from dew on the sidewalk. If you are going to use them often, don't expect them to last long. I wasn't in them 8+ hours a day and they still started to degrade after 1 year. Maybe that's the normal shoe life now but I used to get 4 years out of my \"errand\" shoes before I would wear theough the top fabric...never the sole."

They are supportive and lightweight without being overly restrictive on my ankle and foot movement, which is a plus. The size is to be expected. I usually wear a size or two larger in running shoes, so I have plenty of room in the toe box for long runs and I ordered these two sizes up and they fit me, as expected with plenty of room for my toes and tight enough to give me support and not slide around. 5 stars! I recommend!"

But I find that Nike's will only last me about a year-18 months before they have a hole, worn out looking, etc. and cost around $75. So this time I decided to buy a \"no name\" brand of sneaker for $40 and see how that goes.  I really like these sneakers. They are light weight, with lots of support and very comfortable.  I'm curious to see how long they last - but for now I'm happy with them!"

I would never recommend these shoes for anyone to run or even exercise in.  I tried exercising in them and my feet and legs hurt, finally had to take shoes off during the workout.

As soon as I take them off and begin to walk around flat footed, the pain in my knees goes away after awhile.  The shoe itself seems well constructed though the insole in very flat.  I have never had an athletic shoe do this before.  The heel is quite high so maybe that is what is causing me to stand differently.
