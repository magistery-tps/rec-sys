They spot a little if your caught out in the rain. The tow box is a little more narrow than I\u2019m used to. Arch is ok. Over all they are a little tight. They are the correct size me.  One size up would be too big and one size down would\u2019ve been tight and I would have returned them.  My suggestion, if you have a wide foot, this is really not for you. This is not their fault but had the toe box been a little wider, they would have gotten 5 stars."

I don't know why the description indicates these are suede. If you look at the pictures of the blue, the 1st picture is what you will receive. You will notice in the other pictures, the shoes ARE suede as you can see the difference in the amount of furryness (lol) which is what they would look like if they were legit suede."

Unless it\u2019s snowing or raining hard, this is the shoe I wear. Comfortable, supportive, stylish and reasonably priced. When I start to feel the insoles wearing  down, I get a pair of the Superfeet insoles and I get more mileage from the sneakers. The sneaker itself never rips or falls apart. The only reason I get a brand new pair is because sole gets some wear and tear. Totally normal for the amount of walking I do and the hell I put them through."

These are made for small, thin feet, probably not unlike the person who made them.  One supposes the foot blanks used to size these shoes are modeled on thinner framed feet.  It's not that the leather won't eventually stretch (the one's I got are suede).  it's that the rubber sole is about 3/16ths of an inch too narrow, so I can feel the edges of my feet in the toe box resting on the rubber outsole walls.  I wore them for a few weeks to see if they would break in, but all that did is make things more pronounced.  As the insole molded to my foot, I could feel the outsole walls more and more. Great shoes if you have feet like skis and normally find shoes are too wide in the toe box."

I do not have abnormal feet, my feet are not fat or too wide, I am 5'11.1/4\" exactly barefoot and weigh 155lbs. Does this sound like someone with too fat of a foot? What kills me is that they look/appear wider than my also beloved Gazelles that Adidas makes, however, they and I have four pair of them, do not do that at all??? So I can't quite figure it out, but as far as being able to style and profile with these, it hurts too much to look friggin awesome in these blue on blacks. So I wish someone from Puma could explain why they are screwing up design construction on their left shoes? My ever so ubiquitous black and whites, left shoe is fine, but these my Baskets, are anything but fine. It's tough having a beautiful shoe you are afraid to wear because of the pain they cause the left 5th digit. Buyer beware of these design flaws, because it may end up happening to you..."
