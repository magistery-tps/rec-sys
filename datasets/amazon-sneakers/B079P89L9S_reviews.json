I wear wide and this is a wide footbed.  I found this model to be more comfortable then even the similar looking Ecco's which is saying a lot.  The cushioning was superior and the leather breaks in quickly and is very soft.  The only thing that needs cushioning is the colar as there is no rim cushion however i added a heel cushion so problem solved.  This an ideal shoe as a smart casual shoe for a trip or anytime something nicer than a running shoe is needed.  For $79 they are a steal in my opinion. Update after 1 month.  Super Comfy almost slipper like!  One of the best shoes i own!"

Reading the reviews and this being shipped to Korea I decided to go with the 11 1/2 risking them being too small and just trusting reviews.  Well, it was a good choice.  I might even fit into an 11 on these.  They definitely come big.  Don't have any worries going down a half size, at all.  They may be narrow, that's my only caveat.  I figure my feet are average width, and these fit width wise a little loose, but not that far off.  The shoe is definitely roomy on me. This is my first time going back to leather after doing mostly canvas for the last 6 years (Sketcher slip ons).  Compared to Sketchers these are a little less padded in the footbed, but still comfortable.  I'm just not use to having scratched leather so easily, but I imagine that's unavoidable.  Eventually they'll just look worn I assume.  All in all pretty satisfied with them.  They are light, comfortable enough, and really nicely constructed.  Love the suede patches adorning them.  I remember Rockports being super comfortable, feel like these may be a step down from that, but not uncomfortable by any means."

Now, with my heel all the way touching, it is about a half size larger than I expected, so my feet slide forward. These shoes are VERY light, at first I was taken back, they are lighter than any of my other leather shoes. The sole in these shoes feel like memory foam and are comfortable to walk in but I think over time it will wear out and I'll need to replace them. There is a rubberized strip on the heal of the shoe for grip, wearing socks to absorb the rubbing from this is a must or your heel will be raw. There also is a strip inside the toe of the shoe that supports under your toes, at first it was a weird feeling but feels normal now. My only real gripe is that I frequently sit in my chair with my ankles crossed with toes on the floor bending the toes of the shoes. So now there are some really mean creases in the toes of the shoes that do not heal, they are there forever now. Overall a great shoe, next time, a half size smaller and less toe bending and I'll be golden. I recommend them."

They seriously are a half size bigger than you'd expect - I wear a size 15, so I ignored this, and I had so much extra toe room. So, please keep this in mind if you want to order them. I think the mid-sole is supposed to be memory foam? Whatever it is, it didn't do much for me. It felt about the same as walking in some chucks. They're not uncomfortable. I guess I can only recommend them to someone who doesn't do a lot of walking."

The only problem with these is the size and the sound it makes when I am walking, and I think the two problems are related. I have worn size 13 for the last 35 years, but these size 13\u2019s are too big. I would exchange them but size 12 would probably be too small, and they don\u2019t make 12.5.

I generally don't feel overheated in shoes, but after a day at work I can't wait to get these off. -the interior sole feels like I'm walking on very stiff egg crate or honeycomb material. It feels sharp and uncomfortable. After wearing for the first day I thought I'd left new shoe cardboard inserts in the shoes, took out the inner \"cushion\" and found that they are definitely part of the shoe and should be left in. I rarely wear these now because of these two short-comings and am reluctant to buy another pair of Rockports now."

When the shoes arrived I opened the box and there was a leaflet stating that worn shoes cannot be returned.  Obviously, stipulations about returns are always indicated when buying a product but I've never received a leaflet that looks like a 1 sentence \"word document\" that someone had just typed out.  It should be obvious that worn shoes can't be returned unless there was a defect.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SHOES LOOK LIKE THEY HAD BEEN WORN.  I don't see how that could have been missed when the shoes were shipped.  The right shoe was double-knotted and as the pictures indicate, several scuff marks are readily visible and the soles of both shoes are dirty.  I like the shoes but this seller had to have know they had been worn.  The paper covering the shoes was crumpled.  On top of this, I have to pay a $5 restocking fee.  Basically, it appears as though they intentionally shipped a worn pair of shoes with a note saying that worn shoes cannot be returned.  Again, most people understand that worn shoes can't be returned.  Bad business practice!  Otherwise, they are nice shoes and fit well.  I just placed an order from the Rockport Store."
