I'm a 6 1/2 in 95% of sneakers so i just didnt expect them to be big and just threw them on and ran out the door. A half size down...maybe even a full size would have been much better. The style really cute and on trend. They're fairly comfortable, but theyre only average in support like a 6/10 on support and comfort. (You can buy new ones and change the insoles if this is your only concernt though) I've worn them a bit even though they're too big and I love that they don't look dirty or get stained.

They have good support while still being soft and I am on feet walking and running much of the day. Lately from Amazon I have received several knockoffs. They were not real Reebok Classic sneakers. I took them to the store and compared and spoke with the people selling sneakers and theses were knock offs. This has happened several times. I sent the ones I did not wear back to amazon and now I go to the store to get my Reeboks. They are a little more expensive but they are real. It is a waste of money to get knockoffs because they do not have the support or hold up very long. This is the first disappointment that I have had with Amazon."

And seeing them in a mirror is a lot better. They're super comfortable. The sole is nice and squishy and there is actually a little arch support. Keep in mind when ordering though, the sizing is way off. I'd tried them on in a store so I knew what size I needed but if I'd have ordered my regular size it would have been a waste of time. I'm normally a size 8 in athletic shoes like this. Very occasionally I have to size down to a 7.5. I bought these in a size 7 and they are still a little more roomy in the toe box than I prefer but sizing down even more to the 6.5 makes them too short and my toe hits the end. I'll just have to get used to them a little bit but they are really cute and super comfortable. There's nothing like a nice fresh white pair of sneakers to make you feel good!"

First of all they\u2019re too big and slip. But the shoe itself is super narrow. The soles squeak, the leather is so stiff that it hurts the top of the foot when you step. The insoles are hard as a rock. They have a thin \u201cmemory\u201d foam lining but I\u2019ll tell you right now that even my Adidas Cloudfoam sneakers that have zero support (and I have 4 different pairs) are WAY more comfortable in the sole. There\u2019s no spring back when you step, it\u2019s like walking on 2x4 with a thin layer of foam. I can\u2019t imagine why they even call this a running shoe. No one should wear these running.
