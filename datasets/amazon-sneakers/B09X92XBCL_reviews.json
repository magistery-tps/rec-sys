He walks on his toes, ALWAYS! So it difficult finding shoes that work and don't slip up and down and eventually completely come off. This is by far best shoes I've found for him that stay on.  Holding up well so far 1 month into school. Looks good dressed up or down. Very happy with shoes!"

We got around 3-4 months out of the pair for before this before the rubber started peeling off of the bottom but this time was a few WEEKS so I\u2019m thinking they were either not authentic or that we received a defective pair. We purchased them on 1/13/22 and got them a few days later and it\u2019s now 2/22/22 and they are falling apart. My son only wears them to school, they barely go outside there due to weather and the back fabric has completely frayed and looks ridiculous. For the price of these shoes, I\u2019d expect to get longer than a MONTH with them of normal use. I\u2019m really disappointed and now my son needs another pair of new sneakers less than 5 weeks after getting these. Does UA stand behind their sneakers? What can I do about these sneakers that are a mere several weeks old that can no longer be worn?"

He did not wear this shoe every day and did not do any sports or unusual activities that would explain the damage, especially since the left shoe is fine. I contacted Under Armour directly with my receipt and images. I thought this may have been a manufacturing fluke since we have other UA tennis shoes that are more than a year old and on their second kid that look better than this shoe that is less than 2 weeks old. I was shocked that UA did not stand by their product either. They offered me a 15% off coupon to buy another pair.
