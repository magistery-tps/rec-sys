I have a large foot that is wide so it\u2019s difficult to find shoes that actually fit me and I end up having to get men\u2019s sizes instead. It was a little tight the first few days wearing which made me nervous about the size I chose but it\u2019s been almost 2 weeks and they are so comfortable! I work in a hospital and am on my feet a lot so these shoes I highly recommend for a face paced work environment."

When I ordered my normal size shoe it was way too small so I recommend you go at least a half size bigger when ordering this shoe. The shoe is waterproof which is exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with my shoes."

It doesn't slide around, I just don't like that it is removable (there isn't anything underneath to provide support, so the insole is necessary)"
