  "description": "Reebok Women's Classic Leather Harman Run Sneaker elevates your everyday style. This women\u2019s shoe is just the ticket.

Reebok was founded for one of the best reasons possible: athletes wanted to run faster. So in the 1890s, Joseph William Foster made some of the first known running shoes with spikes in them.
