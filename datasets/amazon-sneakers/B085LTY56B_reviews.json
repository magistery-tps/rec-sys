If you don't need a certain color, I would purchase the cheaper ones. (They are about half the price of this color.) This time when I received the shoes after a few days of him wearing them they began making a clicking sound every time he stepped. (Very annoying and disruptive in the workplace) I thought maybe something had gotten in the tread. We cleaned them and this did not resolve the issue. I could not return them because he had worn them. I had to purchase a second pair within a week of ordering the first pair. Very frustrating since they are over $100 pair. Hopefully you'll have better luck then us."

They look so good -- so streamlined and uncluttered, with the iconic Nike swoosh, a color scheme that channels the original Air Jordan shoe, and a projection of class and timelessness in an era of obnoxiously loud shoe designs. What I didn't expect at this low price point is a light, breathable, elite-performing running shoe: They offer the ample cushion I now need after a period of conspicuous consumption, and feel spring-loaded as they push back against the road or sidewalk. Fit is true to U.S. sizing with no sore feet in the break-in period. An elite running shoe in every way, and the fact they're half the price of what I'm used to spending is a massive bonus. - (Was this review of use? If so, let me know by clicking \"Helpful.\" Cheers!)"

    "message": "I have been a lifelong Nike customer  - especially for shoes. I purchased these off of amazon as a replacement to a well loved pair of old nike running shoes. I liked them because they had a lot of options in wide sizes and I really liked the black/anthracite color combo. I wore these probably 4-5 days a week doing 4 mile walks on paved roads, and for the first 3 months of ownership they were wonderful. Fit perfect, comfortable, stylish - all that I've come to expect from Nike. However, after about the 3rd month of wearing these both shoes developed holes right at the achilles tendon and there were these razor sharp plastic pieces poking through the shoes (see pictures, hard to see, but there is a white plastic part poking through the back). This pretty quickly made these shoes unwearable as the plastic was digging into my skin. I figured something has to be defective here, why would BOTH shoes develop these holes in the exact same spot from what I would consider light use for running shoes. Unfortunately, 3 months is just outside the amazon limit for returns so I turned to Nike expecting them to remedy this for me, I filled a claim through their customer support system and paid to send them the shoes back. about a week and a half later Nike told me that this was \"wear and tear\" and that they would not return / refund / exchange the shoes - I escalated the issue and asked for another review, which was AGAIN rejected and I was told it's wear and tear. So ultimately, I ended up out 80 bucks for the shoes, 10 bucks to ship them to nike for essentially 3 months of light use. This is NOT how I would expect a brand I've been loyal to for years to handle it's customers or it's products. Needless to say, after nike returned my shoes to me, I promptly threw them (and my 90 dollars) in the trash and order some Under Armour Infinite running 2's. Sadly, this is likely my last nike product, I can't purchase products from a company not willing to stand behind its brand. I'd highly recommend avoiding this shoe, unless u like sharp plastic :)."

Some of the reviews complained about a clicking noise, I have no clue what they are talking about, but I'm buying a second pair for when I'm not working out. I got the all black color."
