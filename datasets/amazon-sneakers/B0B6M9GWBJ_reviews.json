These shoes are amazing. I\u2019ve washed them so many times I couldn\u2019t give you a number if I tried \ud83d\ude02 they appear to be made of just canvas and rubber which is the perfect combo.

It's definately over priced at $20 should be more like $12-$15. I would not recommend this for women unless you have a wider foot and have trouble wearing regular women's sneakers."

I ordered an 8 and my toes are pretty close to the front. These aren't work out shoes or long walk shoes but they're super cute and really well put together for the price."

    "message": "Granted these shoes have barely any arch support and I\u2019m a hairdresser and stand all day, but since my feet are already used to that kinda stuff, these shoes are extra comfy and I love wearing them. They fit nicely, despite me having one foot slightly larger than the other so in any shoe I buy I have to make sure they\u2019re a half size bigger so my right foot fits comfortably. They\u2019re cute, and go with most outfits. But again, no arch support, very flat shoe so beware."

That said, if you need a flat shoe to deadlift, have high arches and don\u2019t like padding, or both\u2014 this is a great choice for the price! It was exactly what I expected it to be: a reasonably well-made, no-frills canvas shoe. Since I use them to lift, I\u2019m sure this will not be my last pair."

These shoes immediately gave me blisters because they rubbed against my feet and after weeks, I still have a scab from the blister. These shoes are very uncomfortable. They are also cheaply made and not good quality. It was suggested that I get a half size up, so I did, but I would\u2019ve been totally fine with my normal size. I do not recommend buying these."
