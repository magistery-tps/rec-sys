They are about the only ones that takes care of my problem with out buying two pairs of shoes. I wear an 11 on my right foot and on my size 11 left foot I wear an AFO Arizona brace because of Charcart's  foot. These shoes in a 12 extra wide lets me get in the left shoe wearing my brace and I can chinch the right foot down tight enough to wear. I find them very durable.

When I put them on they felt fine, but after walking around with them after a shift they felt too small.  I then ordered two pair of these from amazon in size 14.  I have plenty of toe room with the 14's and they feel much better.  I have only worn them for three weeks.  They are light weight, comfortable, and are holding up great so far.  I have never worn a size 14 ever (was a 12 for long time) but the 14's work for me with plenty of toe room.  The size issue may just be me I don't know but I do like them and I have a back up pair when these wear out."

I've had mine for a while now, and despite having a walk-heavy job, they still have that rigid new-shoe feel. They are pretty tight for the size, though. I read reviews saying that you should order a size larger, and while I didn't do that, I did make sure to get the wider model, and it's still pretty dang snug. It's nothing terrible, but it does make me want to listen and order at least a half-size larger next time."

    "message": "So anyone buying slip proof work shoes like myself are probably working in a wet environment dealing with presumably food adjacent work. For me, it's a fishery. All my work shoes last roughly 90 days. These Fila shoes were a good price, took longer to break in then I'd like (about 3 weeks, were tight at the toes for a 9.5 Wide but got to shape in time). The pleather coating only started falling off about 80 days in or so, which for constantly having scalding hot shrimp oil, poached salmon water, or lobster fat on it was pretty good I'd say. The foam cushioning gave way after about 5 weeks but still offered good support for 8 hour shifts. Work shoes for under 70$ are never going to last longer then 4 months, once these broke in they're the second most compostable work shoes I've ever had. Not enough to buy another pair, I got mine for around 34-ish. However if the pair I replaced these with don't work out, I'm buying another pair if they're under 42$ and dear reader I suggest you do the same. The actual slip resistance was really solid too, light treads so nothing really got stuck in there. Stink resistant too tying back into the fact again, fishery work. The material is good at not absorbing water, oils, or scents. Anyone in food services should know that if it gets in above 4 inches of water or gets directly blasted with a hose though, they will stay soggy for about 4 hours. Otherwise they're great actually. Shoes are expensive if you're buying in this price range it's for comport not for a long, lasting relationship with some toe containers."

I got these in, have been trying them out for a couple weeks now, and I am quite satisfied. They're light, comfortable, flexible, and even without an additional insole they are good to wear for standing during an eight-hour shift with plenty of walking. I was concerned they would be too tight but the fit is actually pretty good, only real drawback is if you want an additional insole you have to use a pretty thin one because a standard Dr. Scholl's insert made it almost cramped in this shoe; I had to remove it in order to feel comfortable again. Other than that there are no serious issues and the shoe has a good grip on flooring so they're perfectly fine for the work site (my job requires slip-resistant shoes but not steel-toed, so I'm good to go). Highly recommend."

The one minor issue I have with them is that the treads catch and hold everything from dog crap to dirt and mud. I step in dog crap one day and had to use a hose at full stream to remove it all as a stick and shuffling on the grass didn't help at all. Mud is the same. Minus 1 star for that. Stick to regular roads and I have no issue. Don't know if they will keep water out as it has been very dry here this fall. Time will tell."

The memory foam is good but again the arch support is very minor and personally I need more than what it comes with. I\u2019d say I need Mabye half an inch or more of arch support and the shoe comes with Mabye 1/4inch or less"
