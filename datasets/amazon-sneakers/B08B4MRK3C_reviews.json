However, I can only tolerate them for a lil while without having to switch my shoes midday. I have a desk job, so it's not like I'm on my feet a lot either. The issue for me is that these shoes hurt the forefoot bone and I have thin feet. Not sure what the issue is but unfortunately they'll just sit in my closet."

    "message": "I got this in both black and taupe size 9.5. However for some reason the taupe is extra tight and I felt it the moment I slipped my feet in without zipping up. I wore it twice hoping it would stretch but I didn't. Couldn't keep it on for more than an hour. I'm surprised especially since I do not have this problem with the black pair. Update: I did not wear this shoe for a couple of months but decided to try again. I'm wearing at least once a week. In the beginning I have to remove during the day as it was tight. But I am able to wear it for longer periods. It is definitely stretching now. But still tight Update 2: A year and a half later ..... no longer trying to stretch out the taupe one just too painful. Been wearing the black 4-5 days a week for work and its great. But the sole has worn out on the outside heel on both sides (could be because of how i walk) to the point where its uncomfortable. but for a year and a half of use for the price id buy again to replace these. black only tho. wont chance getting any other colour as i live outside of the US and returning isnt possible."

If I wear these for any length of time my back hurts, my hips hurt and my knees ache. I don't really know what that means for how these are designed, but it's not for comfort! They're very cute and I wish I loved to wear them but alas... I don't. I wear them for short periods of time but never all day. If you're a spry youngster who doesn't yet care about shoe comfort (you will one day, I promise) then buy these! If you're an elder millennial with old bones and joints, move along. I got an 8.5 because of other reviews and I usually wear an 8. They fit fine."
