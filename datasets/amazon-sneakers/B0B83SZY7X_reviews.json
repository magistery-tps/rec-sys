Foam insoles have a history of breaking down after just a few weeks or months.  With the Amazing Gel Insoles, the support is much better.  2) The arch support is weak and could be done better. We will see how the overall performance of he shoes are in 6 months."

I have plantar fasciitis so I was looking forward to a sneaker with arch support.  After wearing them all day, my plantar fasciitis felt a little worse, but my foot also hurt in other places and my ankles hurt.  The next morning my feet and ankles were sore. These are so cushy they are unstable which is why my ankle hurts, and my foot sunk into them deep enough it hurt other joints in my feet.  Additionally there is no rubber treads so they are slippery.  I have never seen a sneaker where you are just stepping on the foam.  Also they don't have the lock loop at the top like other sneakers so the pressure is tight on the top of my foot which restricts blood flow to my toes. These have the potential to be great, but need several improvements. As is, these are not worth they are charging for them."
