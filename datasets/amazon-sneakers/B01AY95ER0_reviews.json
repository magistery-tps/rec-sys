This is actually my second purchase of this shoe.  The first one, I ordered was a size 8 and it was way too loose and was way too big for me.  So, while reading the description, they do run a bit bigger than usual, so I try again.  I also changed it up and ordered the platform style.  I could always use an inch boost on my height. Anyways, today is the first day that I wore the shoe around the house.  First thing I noticed, WOW....very stiff sole.  As soon as I step to walk, my heel is sliding, not completely out, but you can feel and hear it sliding in and out.  Walked around some more to decipher if it is the shoe or my foot.  It's the shoe.  The sole is STIFF.  There is really no give to it.  I understand that I got the platform style, however, I would think it will bend some. I really would like to love this shoe.  I am still on the fence if I should return it.  Maybe I'll use it around the house a few more times and see how it feels."

    "message": "Super cute!! I just got these and I love the look already. I ordered a US 6.5, my true size\u2026couple of notes about that: \u2022 Feel: These shoes are SOLID. Quite a bit of heft to them, mostly due to the platform. Good news is I can throw out my ankle weights now! The canvas is pretty inflexible at first, especially around the toe, so you\u2019re definitely not getting Converse-level comfort right off the bat. \u2022 Fit: If you have a narrow heel, like me, you\u2019re going to want thicker socks or tights. I second the reviewer\u2019s suggestion to get some heel inserts. Because the platform is so solid, there isn\u2019t much give and the back of the shoe will slide right off your foot with every step. I was able to adjust the rest of the shoe with the laces and they fit decently everywhere else! \u2022 Function: These are not walking shoes. Great for a stroll or photos but not much else. That\u2019s all I needed them for, though. You won\u2019t be able to bend your foot all the way because of the platform, you can kinda see that in my second photo. Overall, these are very cute but definitely not something you should wear everyday. I purchased mine with a gift card, but if $45 is too steep and you want them to last I\u2019d keep that in mind. If I can break these in at all I will come back and update! :)"

    "message": "I read all the other reviews and sized down half a size. I\u2019m usually a 7 and I ordered 6.5, and it was a perfect fit. Pros 1) I found it really comfortable. To my surprise, it didn\u2019t need any breaking in. The material of the shoe keeps its shape yes is pretty pliable, there was no stiff part of the shoe. Yes, there is not much arch support but the platform provided so much cushioning from the hard ground. I wore it almost everyday on holiday and walked over 20,000 steps per day. 2) I love the look of it. Looks like an elevated basic shoe and somehow the cutting and design makes my wide feet look quite narrow. It also matches almost everything! Cons 1) Like everyone said, your heel does tend to slip out the back when you walk. I tied my laces in a cross pattern and pull it super tight at the end when I\u2019m tying my laces, and that solved it. 2) It seems to get dirty quite easily. I personally like the worn in look for my sneakers but others might find it hard keeping it white! Overall, I would highly recommend it. I love my pair and wear it all the time!"

They fit ok,but the seam tongue of the shoe made it uncomfortable,  so I decided to try the 6.5 again but add a heel cushion to make it fit better. It didn't work, while the shoe sort of fit,  it was still to large and the weight from the soles kept pulling the show off my feet. Sadly I had to return. I love Superga, I just wish they either made them less unisex or some more tailored to a woman's narrower foot. I did find some lovely Kate Spade by Keds platforms and the Toms Platform Sneaker also fit well."

The entire sole is thick as you\u2019d expect from a platform sneaker.

I do not think these would be good walking shoes until you\u2019ve worn them in for that reason because I was getting some rubbing on my heal that would had easily turned into a blister if I hadn\u2019t taken them off.

    "message": "Had bought these shoes for my sister who had fractured her foot and had to wear a boot.  Unfortunately her regular shoes didn't not match the sole height difference for the boot and caused her to be uncomfortable while walking.  I had searched many shoes to look for the right size and ended up buying these. Given her changed mood she absolutely loves these!! although she is only currently wearing one shoe she mentions it to be one of the most comfortable shoes she has ever worn. She usually goes for a wider shoe width which was a main concern when purchasing this pair but it was an exact fit and comfortable for her needs. The sole height difference is a big difference in which she is able to have some normality in being able to walk/stand while she recovers. For those that wish to buy a shoe with a similar situation and shoe width is an issue, fear not as these could potentially help in keeping feet comfortable without putting unneeded pressure on either foot to maintain balance."

I sized a half size DOWN from my normal size and they fit great. It Is true what previous reviews are stating about the shoes sole not being flexible causing the shoe to slide on the ankle when you walk. If you tie the shoe tightly it\u2019s not that bad. You will definitely need to wear higher cut socks with these because of that. That being said- I have never tried on other platform shoes so Maybe they all have inflexible soles because of The platform thickness? Not sure , but regardless the shoes are cute enough it doesn\u2019t bother me! You will need to keep a tide stick and a Magic eraser on hand. The scuff easily as any white shoe would. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sole."

Second, the sole is heavy, it is in rubber so don't think to buy light running shoes, that is not the case here. Third, they are a little bit large in the arch part, the socks slip sometimes. Fourth, I was confused about the numbers because numbers didn't match with  centimeters! I chose the correct number only because I know that I usually wear 38.5 (US W 8) which is around 25 cm! I bought the number 39 and it is perfect. So, don't look at the size chart (even in the superga web site is not correct!) The centimeters don't match with the numbers! Just take your usual number and I think would fit perfectly. I put the picture with the right size chart that you can find on the box! I hope this review can help you!"

They are definitely snug in the toe and my toe is right up at the front of the shoe but because they are canvas, I expect they will stretch and comform to my foot a bit with wear. As I also read, the laces really need to be tightened because even with the snugness in the toe, the heel still slips out a bit. The platform is so cute with so many clothes from shorts to dresses, skirts, jeans, etc. They are heavy so I will probably not be wearing them when I have to walk for any length of time, but they are definitely cute. I wore them without a sock to go shopping and run errands and so far, no rubbing. Although I do expect some to occur with additional wear until they wear-in. I tried a no-show sock and because the heel slips a bit, the socks ended up bunched up under my foot inside the shoe. But I am still happy with this purchase!"

In the shoe box was a tag I used to go online and verify this was a true Superga shoe. My pair bought here didn't have the tag verifier. The boxes are different. My first pair has 5 eyelets for shoe laces. This pair has 6. They fit well and are very comfortable, though very slightly loose  The platform soles give my 5\" frame a nice little lift. I am going to buy some coloured laces to switch off with different outfits. The body of the shoe is not smooth canvas. It is, like my first pair in navy blue, a rougher woven material. I like it because it is different and raises it above the average canvas sneakers. I doubt these are genuine Suoerga's. Still close enough for the lower price, to keep them. Casual enough to wear with chino's, jeans or shorts ad classic enough to wear with a skirt. A good buy."

I almost donated them, BUT, they are so darn cute I pressed on and carried band aids in my purse. I am so glad I did because now my superga's are the most comfortable shoes I own!!! I urge you to give these shoes a break in period before you judge them! The sole is so thick that they need time to get a little flexibility..but these shoes will perfectly conform to your foot...like a great pair of jeans, and you'll never want to take them off. Over the last few years, my husband and I will go the the amusement park for a few hours and I always end up in excruciating foot pain and can barely walk back to the car!! We went to the park a few days ago and I wore my Supergas. After 3 hours of straight walking my feet felt fantastic!!! Going to order 2 more pair!! Ladies, before you return these, break them in...it's a painful process but well worth it in the end!! BTW, I usually wear a 6 1/2-7 in tennis shoes and I ordered the 36/6 and they are perfect.

I know I have to break them in and when I do, I know it'll be fine. Walking is a bit of an adjustment since well, they are platforms and flat platforms too. It adds about 2 inches to height. My foot is narrow with a small heel and the shoe itself is very narrow. I'm flat footed and I can confirm that the shoe itself is flat too so it works fine for me! lol For really arched people this might be a problem. Think converse. The design of the shoe is beautiful! I can see myself wearing with shorts, pants, dresses, long coats, etc. The color is white and a very clean white too.

Keep in mide there are European sizes. And (oddly) a 38 is an 8 a 39 is a 9. There is no 38 1/2 option. There is a 37 1/2 which would be comparable to a size 7 USA."

    "message": "These shoes are incredibly cute! I was concerned about so many people having issues with sizing and being very uncomfortable. I have found the solution guys; Gel heel inserts!! I\u2019m normally a size 7 and only went down half a size with theses (6.5 = 37) they seemed okay but still slightly roomy. On top of that I felt how stiff and flat they made my feet feel. The perfect solution is to get a gel arch insole. This way it takes up that little roomy feel you have at the back and are instantly more comfy! I think if I went down a full size I wouldn\u2019t have had room for gel heel insoles and I\u2019m telling you, you NEED foot support inserts for these babies, otherwise you are going to be uncomfortable. So in conclusion, go down only a half a size, leaving room for heel support inserts or full arch and heel supports insoles. Enjoy!"

This is fine but causes the back to move a bit when waking (even if tied tight) which is why I imagine some reviewers reported discomfort/ankle pain. They do not feel totally flat inside but they do not have a great amount of support. These seem more fashion over function - I think they will be comfortable during daily activities but are not really for sports/hiking/etc. Great to catch them on sale!"
