It goes from the refrigerator or freezer to the oven or microwave without a problem.  Its classic white good looks make this covered round dish a beautiful complement to your fine china or everyday dishes.  And after use at your table, food can be stored in it in either the refrigerator or freezer. I've been using Corning Ware products for four decades and still think they make a high quality product.  That's an incredible compliment in today's world of anticipated 'use/break/replace' thinking.  If you stop to think about it, how many glass items have you received  more than 10 years ago (that you use several times a week)  that are still functioning like the first day you got them?"

It seems in the past decade or two that they've become a touch more fragile, a little more prone to chipping, but that could simply be old-age and clumsiness making me a little less careful about handling them. I use these, no only for cooking, but for serving hot soups, casseroles, anything that might heat a thinner-walled bowl past the comfort point. I rarely store in them (I've got lots of cheap plastic for that - I'm not tying up my good ceramic dishes for fridge storage)."

Many have complained about the lid or the product being thin and easily breakable. The lid is supposed to just sit on the dish, it does not seal in any way. This does not keep it from working when you cook with it and allows steam to escape like it should. The dish does not seem thin to me and anything that is not made of metal or plastic can be easily broken. Hopefully you take care with breakable plates and glasses so I don't think this should be any harder to take care of than a plate."
