I went through 115 degree heat to down pours with soaking socks and shoes and had no blisters or issues. Plus they dried out by the next day with just a little hair dryer action. I had different shoes on previous trips and my feet were so sore after a few days that I dreaded walking anymore.

We immediately put rubber shoelaces in the shoes, and they suddenly become wonderful, slip on, comfortable shoes. Also, the shoes last for a long while before wearing out. I wear pairs of these for at least a year, almost every day, and I have no foot pain. They have loads of cushioning that lasts and lasts. As I am known to be tough on shoes, this is a major positive. If I had to make a complaint, it would be that the wide shoes don't come in cute colors, like the \"normal width\" shoes do.  I'd love a pair of cute sneakers in purple or a lively print. But that doesn't happen if you have feet that are wider than \"normal feet.\" So, I settle for colored laces, and that makes them a little more cheerful. I am planning to take one of the older pair of shoes and painting them, to see if they look more customized this year. If so, then watch out!  There are going to be a pair of wildly colorful versions of these shoes walking around in Raleigh, NC or Boston, MA!"
