To my surprise, it was very hard, then I thought this was not going to be comfortable at all.  The first day I wore them at work, I was amazed.  I now work as a delivery driver for 3-4 hours a day and always on my feet.  This shoe has the perfect hard sole, so I don't feel any rocks in gravel driveways or wooded areas.  There are four pads within the shoe.  Under the bend of the toes, at the ball of the foot, arch support, and at the heel.  I also wear these shoes when I walk up to 3.5 miles every night and when I'm done, my feet feel like they have been massaged during that time.  I don't want to take the shoes off, but I can't sleep with them on. I have recommended this shoe to friends and family.  A former co-worker of mine has also purchased a pair of these shoes and is also wearing them at work and has said he feels more relaxed when he is done working than with his old shoes he had.  I am looking to buy other colors of this same shoe to expand my shoe collection."

They did not cost much and so they have kind of a cheap appearance...they're entirely plastic on the outside.  The inside is softer fabric-like material.  I'll see if they are long-lasting and add to this post later on if I learn more on this.  The color is as shown online. People admire them.  They arrived quickly."

    "message": "I bought these shoes because they were significantly less expensive than the shoes I usually buy.  They look cool but they are not very comfortable, at least not at first.  The sole is very rigid (harder than most other shoes I have experienced), both inside and outside the shoe.  After wearing these shoes for a few days, my feet still hurt but it's less than it was initially.  I hope that eventually I will be able to wear the shoes without discomfort. One thing to watch out for -- the soles are not flat in two ways: #1 the surface of the sole itself is wavy, and #2 there are cutouts/empty spaces in each shoe which can make driving with these shoes a little tricky.  More than once, my foot has slipped off the accelerator or brake pedal, or the empty space of a shoe has caught the edge of a pedal.  Thankfully, my current vehicle is automatic transition so I only have one shoe/foot to worry about... but I have had a couple of \"scary\" moments as I went to apply a pedal and had it not work because of funky interaction between the pedal and the sole of my shoe.  Like the comfort issue, however, this seems to be happening less and less as I continue wearing the shoes while driving.  So maybe it's just an issue of \"getting used to\" the unusual surface of the sole. I gave the shoes three stars because they do look nice and they are as advertised.  I just didn't pay very close attention to the sole, or think about the problems it could cause me while driving."

Also notice there are two open rings in the underside in the front center and the heel.  At first I thought this is odd, this is different, this is almost cool\u2026 However after an all day wear and wearing them for a walk I had to cut short, I am debating returning them. I have opted for purchasing insoles at the moment. Imagine the ring under the ball of your foot and the upright supports or the \u201cblades\u201d as a dull thick cookie cutter that you walk on all day. It doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being cut obviously but you feel that hole every step. You feel the upright supports and gaps between then every step. The sole above that part of the design should be thicker and denser so as not to feel this. The heel hole isn't really noticeable compared to the tarsal half of your foot. The rest of the shoe is nice, comfortable, and durable feeling."

I wore them for several hours the first day and was pleasantly surprised that the shoes were as comfortable as a broken-in pair. The fit, for my size 13 foot, was as close as any shoe I have ever purchased. Of course, no shoe adequately compensates for my arthritis bumps, but the soft, flexible nature of this shoe does a respectable job of accommodating those bumps. The open web design of the upper part of the shoe allows one's feet to stay cooler and dryer than the shoes that are mostly leather or faux leather, which make my feet sweat. I highly recommend this shoe for anyone looking for a comfortable, affordable shoe that doesn't seem to have a break-in period."

    "message": "These are a pair of nice shoes. I get so many compliments that I didn't expect. They are comfortable and for the price, I can't explain. I'm still dumbfounded that people pay hundreds of dollars for BRAND shoes when they can get some nice shoes less than $50. Only one small issue; I can't drive in them because of my pedals. I have already ordered some more shoes like this. I love bragging to my adult son how much money I saved!"

    "message": "This pair of shoes looks really nice; both on-line, as well as in real life when the order arrived. This is sadly where my positive impressions end. These shoes were quite tight from the onset. I knew it was not available in a wide-fit option; I nevertheless hoped that it will mold around my foot during wearing. After 4 weeks, my feet were in extreme agony, caused by these shoes. Upon contacting amazon, they were extremely generous, and offered to refund this purchase to me (I guess due to my 20 year membership with regular purchases from amazon.) Wearing these shoes felt as if I was walking with ice-skating roller blades on sidewalks. These shoes have zero arch support; zero cushioning; zero responsiveness (bounce absorption), and zero outsole traction on wet floors such as at the gym. The lesson I learned from this experience is this: just like you cannot expect reliability from a $1,000 vehicle, likewise can you not expect comfort, support and the other absent qualities I mentioned above from a $40 pair of running/walking shoes. It is just not happening. Add to the equation that this is a no-name brand, and you set yourself up for an unsuccessful shoe purchase. I am of the opinion that this shoe should not be offered on amazon (or elsewhere). I have since then  purchased a pair of New Balance shoes via amazon, and I am happy with them - just wish they were available in more colorful options than the predominantly (boring) black I had to settle for in a size 12 Wide fit."
