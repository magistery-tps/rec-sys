Love the style and more arch support than I expected which is GREAT for me. I wear them everyday for a long walks with my dog; insoles are super soft I have no complaints of discomfort and I get a lot of compliments from it. Would definitely purchase NB again."

    "message": "For this price, don't expect the solid NB construction or the support. The sole is comfortable enough if you're using it for city walking or short trips. The sides aren't super solid for extra strength or support there. I was hoping for a little more stability and support as a shoe for walking, but I walk fast and for long-ish distances. This won't hold up for that. Today's 2 mile walk resulted in minor discomfort (gone in an hour so not a big deal), just evidence that these aren't super workout shoes. The look is great and they'll be fine for daily run-around-town use."

(which means your foot has thicker bone than most people, especially near the leg, has nothing to do with arches) Took a few days to break in and conform to my feet, but never once hurt. So long as there keep making their sneakers this way, they have me for life."

Once I put them on I was surprised by how much room the tow box was in comparison to other name brand more expensive sneakers. I would buy them again. But would prefer to wear them without the orthotics I\u2019m suppose to Put inside of them. I wear an 8 in women but Initially thought I would need a half size bigger. Try them on and walk around.
