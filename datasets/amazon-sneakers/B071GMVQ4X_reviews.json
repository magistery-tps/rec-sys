I searched everywhere looking for a women's shoe fitting this description and was about to give up before I found these puma\u2019s. It\u2019s listed as a mens shoe but the mens 7.5 fit my women\u2019s size 8.5/9 foot very well. They are exactly what I wanted!! Very lightweight, comfortable, and fashionable (in my opinion)."

    "message": "They run small -- go a half size up. I am typically a US women's 8 / men's 6.5 / Euro 39. I find that if I order shoes using Euro sizing which is determined by actual length (you can find charts that convert Euro size to centimeters) the fit is more accurate than going with US sizing. The Puma size chart shows Euro 39 corresponds with US men's 7 which is what I ordered and these fit me perfectly. I got the gum sole in white/gold and love the styling. These are more contemporary and sporty looking than most women's white sneakers which can sometimes look like bulky nursing shoes. The quality of leather is good and the construction is good. My only complaint is that after one wearing, the gold foil logo imprint on the foot bed inside one of the shoes started to peel, which is to be expected and not really an issue as this remains out of sight when wearing, however, a printed foot bed would have been appreciated for better esthetic wear. Also, there is a little glue residue around the toe where the gum sole meets the leather. The stitching is excellent. The first time I broke these in I wore them for a whole day while working on my feet and didn't experience any fatigue or aches. Comfort wise, they're not bad, no issues with rubbing and not stiff, however not as comfy and low profile as my favorite Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 (yep, the yellow Uma Thurman Kill Bill ones!), but these are half the price. I would say the Romas are moderate to very good and will get even more comfortable as the leather softens with wear. The arch support is good too.  The grip on the sole is great and the shoe has an average degree of flexibility. I love them and am glad to have the Roma Classic Gum in my rotation for a moderately low profile leather sneaker. Versatile and sporty and good for wearing with jeans, shorts, leggings, or casual dresses. I do wish that Puma would bring back the Aiki Cat slip ons (no laces), but these are a decent alternative within the brand."

    "message": "I use these treadmill and lifting weights.  I use my Asics for squats and these for upper body workouts.  Theses are like my Nike Cortez's except they have a leather tongue instead of Nike's stupid nylon one.  The leather tongue is very luxurious and puts Nike to shame which makes me sad because I like Nike.  I wear these with Puma shirts as to match and so far okay but they need dark navy Puma logos instead of off blues and sissy girl colors like candy or windows 8 start menu. I used to like Puma Suede's but last pair hurt my feet after walking on sidewalks for long amounts of time.  I am not sure why that happened.  Seemed weird like they used to be more comfortable.  Maybe I got a bad pair. Had/have a pair of Puma Dallas I never wear because they are too loose in the width and about 1/2 or more too long.  They slip off the heel when running no matter how tight I lace them (which makes them look long and too skinny and just funny) and they wiggle when I squat which is dangerous and annoying.  The low heel is nice but who cares if it wiggles, how can I lift confidently with wiggle? Puma whirlwind had stupid nubby outsole which looked like dumb golf cleats and worse hurt my feet when I was walking to the mall and in the mall.  On hard surfaces the nubs make a funny noise and people stared at me obviously amused by my choice of footwear.  They click clacked on the hard tile so not good choice for out and about activities.  Maybe sprinting on clay track or grass turf.  Stay off concrete/asphalt/indoor surfaces. The G. Villas seem nice tennis shoe comparable to my Kswiss Classics so I might try them but I do not need tennis shoes right now.  If I did I would rather G Unit Reebox's. The speed cats piqued my interest some time ago but I was not sure if the sleek styling was suitable for casual wear, too European.  I could definitely see the value as sports trainers am I really liked when the outsole was good year rubber tire inspired.  Kind of like racing car slicker tires i.e. less tread more traction.  Now I am into working out more so these would be more appropriate for me as long as I did not combine the with no show socks as is a current trend.  I need coverage on my Achilles plus like wearing Nike quarter crews so you can SEE the logo.  No show's have logo on bottom of sock wear you can not see it, how stupid is that. All in all these are probably the best puma I have had not to low like the speed cats which would have to be purely sports trainers.  I can wear these with jeans and look cool like they are Adidas superstars or something.  Low shoes look bad with jeans unless you are bisexual and wear tight jeans or something.  I wear looser jeans so low shoes tend to be paired training shorts.  I can bench press with loose jeans and look normal. So these worked for the money , look good for casual, knocked off the Asics Corsair's/Nike Cortez but as least incorporated a leather tongue which should be almost mandatory, and are okay for sports and training.  Not hardcore running or atg squats but bench pressing, leg pressing, light track work etc. Update 8/9/2019: I just received a white with black stripe. They are not as good as the originals. They are lighter and cheap naugahyde. They had a scratch on one and the other was crushed. They are comfortable but not the quality I expect from a german brand. Very cheap chinese feel."

I\u2019d love it if a gum sole with black \u201cleather\u201d was an option.

The Amazon picture don't do it justice! Now the negative: This was my first Amazon purchase and I wanted nothing more than a awesome experience buying exactly what I wanted and doing that from home. Unfortunately the right shoe has two glaring marks on it. On the back heel and on the left side. As a person that is use to buying in store, trying my item on before purchasing, this was very disappointing. A brand new pair of shoes should always look like a new pair of shoes. I debated returning them but not sure how well that would work. Now I'm feeling a bit gun shy on making a second Amazon purchase."

Esthetically these shoes are super nice looking. I bought them because I have now learned how to properly care for a pair of white shoes (go me!) and they reminded me of the ones Freddy Mercury wore. Off the bat the material of these felt suuuuper cheap, like they're knock offs or something. I have a pair of white leather Pumas and you can just tell those are quality shoes. My feet are fairly thin and I have never had a problem with \"regular\" (non-wide) shoes being too small or needing wide shoes. These ones, however, were incredibly tight on my feet despite fitting size/length wise. I honestly don't think sizing up would've helped but the cheapness of the shoe made me not want to find out. I did not buy it after I tried it. But thanks for the option Amazon!"

    "message": "I work at an auto parts store, we are required to wear black polishable shoes. every other shoe no matter the price has fallen apart quickly. Dress shoes are not made to be durable or comfortable, especially when you are on your feet, in all sorts of weather conditions , ice,snow.... so when I found these, I was willing to try them because from previous experience puma shoes have been super durable. I have worn the shoes for 2 and a half months at work, and they still look new (even after I spilled brake fluid all over them), and feel just as good as day one. on any other shoes, by the first week they would be all scuffed up ( not these).I look forward to getting a lot more use out of them. And I am curious to see how much better they work in ice, snow, slush compared to dress shoes ive had since they have a really good grip. I will most likely be buying these again when someday they do wear out. Update, 9 months later and these shoes are still going strong, the soles are getting a little wore out and my feet hurt if I do alot of walking, but for the most part still do the job.The rubber on the sides are detaching a little and the bottoms are loosing tread. They do not take water and snow well at all it soaks it right up. (nothing some water proof spray cant fix) Update 2 Well they made it 10 months, and I honestly think if I had not of accidentally put a hole in the side of them from a sharp object that almost cut my foot open at work ( not anything the materials could have prevented, phenomenal synthetic upper) I could have easily gotten another month or 2 out of them buy just putting $1 soles in them. I am still really impressed since most the shoes I wear after work fall apart much quicker and I don't even wear them as much. I estimate that I got about 1800 hours out of these shoes! Now onto pair number two."

    "message": "These fit beautifully, are a great casual shoe, and the price is incredible when you start comparison shopping for a decent shoe. The uppers are soft, the shoe is light, and the fit is comfortable. The first time I put them on, out of the box, was to try out how they felt around the house, and it was hard to tell I had shoes on my feet. That\u2019s not an exaggeration and, yes, they were laced up. Arch support is good for me, but that's an individual thing. They are surprisingly quiet on hard floors compared to some of my other Pumas. I've only been wearing these for a couple of weeks, but I don't need more than that to tell if I like a shoe. In agreement with other reviewers you should go a half size larger when buying a Puma. I take a 10 \u00bd D (M) dress shoe, but my other Pumas are 11\u2019s and they fit well. I\u2019ve always gone with a Wilson tennis for work because sometimes I\u2019m on hard floors for a number of hours and they\u2019ve always given me good support and comfort. So I started out looking to replace my old Wilson Court Avengers, and after weeding out the hideous, those with few or no reviews, all the mesh uppers, and checking on brands I\u2019ve worn before like Adidas, Etonic, and New Balance, I found myself looking at somewhere north of $70-$80 for a pair of kick around work shoes. I found nothing I liked that was reasonably priced (you notice how the price changes depending on your size) so I decided to check on Puma to see what they had and that worked out fine. The only nit I have is the tongue loop, the small twin cuts midway to 2/3 up the tongue that the laces run through to prevent the tongue from sliding into the shoe when you slip your foot in, is the Puma logo at the top of the tongue. I prefer the mid-tongue loop, but that\u2019s an extremely small con to me compared to fit and look."
