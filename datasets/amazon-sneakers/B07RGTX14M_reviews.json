Don't get me wrong, i kept them and have been wearing the everyday around the house but I had to put my orthotics in because they have no arch at all. Sole is pretty thin--they are really only suited to lite athleisure which is why i think they are overpriced (but luckily i got them on sale). On the plus side, they are definitely wide, almost too wide for my wide feet, which is shocking for women's shoes which always run narrow. But best of all is the color! I got the vibrant blue and love it. It is SO nice to be able to buy a wide womens' shoe that isn't grey, white, or pink. The color alone made them a 4 star review, it's somewhere between blue and purple and very bright--love it"

I assume it landed in there accidentally during final production steps, but regardless, I removed it, replaced sole, and they're good to go. These are nice, lightweight, slip on sport shoes. previous review: I bought these in June for my daughter who's out of the country. Got them to her in August. She started wearing them in Sept as it cooled off and really liked them, but just realized recently there's a hard, marble sized lump of something underneath the glued down insole in middle of one shoe. Not supposed to be there. I think it will probable become painful or more noticeable the more she wears them. I'm sure it's an unintentional flaw and would like to exchange for another pair but they're past the \"return window.\" I have a pair of these that I love, however."

I normally wear an 8.5, and I wear a 9 in these\u2026they run just a tad small. Don\u2019t hesitate to get these! Make sure you buy them when they are lower in price. I paid $39.99 for them. They are great, but definitely not worth $64.99!! They are cute and comfortable, but definitely not super supportive."

    "message": "I bought these to wear for everyday, casual but nice sneakers. I haven't bought many sneakers online before, so I decided that they look really nice and I'll try them. When they got here, I tried them on and they still look nice but they feel way too thin for my liking. It feels like I can feel the earth beneath me. So, I put some insoles in them and they feel better but was not thrilled. I took them for a quick stroll and I realized that my feet were trying to roll inwards as if I was standing pigeon toed - which I have never had before. I was wondering why this was happening and believe its because the silhouette curve of the sole goes so far in when it reaches the arch that I guess there's not much surface area for my foot to lay on, which makes my feet want to roll in. It may seem like a subtle design choice, but it really should not be that narrow at the arch. Ultimately, with the insoles that I added and the shoes look nice I guess I will keep them but I will probably have to upgrade in 6 months which is not what I was looking for."

    "message": "This specific one seems quite different from prior ones. While the cut & fit are about spot on, the white foam seems a much less bouncy, but more rigid, almost heavy styrofoam type vs the bouncy cushiony foam of prior shoes. I\u2019ve worn this one now twice, only running errands for a few hours each time so no heavy use or long wear & then foam has visible stress points & creases. I have well worn pairs from 3 years ago that look like this after probably 50 wears. Disappointed in the foam/bottom part this go round. I love this style of shoe, over the last 5 years I\u2019ve had 4-5 diff black white ones as they get used most & I retire them from nice looking to hiking to lawnmowing lol, so they last a while (& currently still have 7 other colors too that are worn when matched) the cut/opening is flattering even with shorts Or t-shirt/sweatshirt dresses - very comfortable, like a not really conforming yet supportive & flexible shoe. I wear the fuel core shoes to hike, mow my lawn, walk dog, workout & just all around leisure. I have a average foot width but size 10 so slimmer, very high arch but tend to like shoes with natural cushion or support vs rigid support, the ties are adjustable to fit the more narrow middle of your foot & then surprisingly they slip on & off & you don\u2019t have to tie each wear. So convenient & a great everyday shoe. Quality seems to be drifting though suddenly as with most things post 2020."

These shoes caught my eye because they reminded me of a stylized, updated take on old-school saddle shoes, and the idea of fuschia saddle shoes just made me giggle. I browsed for awhile but kept coming back, so ordered 1/2 size up as suggested. They fit perfectly and are super comfortable. I would have to go up another 1/2 size if I wanted to wear an athletic sock, but they're just for casual wear so I just wear sock liners. They aren't super supportive, but have enough for a trip to the supermarket or pharmacy. They are cute with jeans, and I think they'll look cute with a white jeans skirt and tee shirt this summer. For the price, I'm happy with my purchase. Edit: I spilled a bowl of tomato -based vegetable soup on my shoes and was afraid they were ruined. I decided to throw them in the wash with a load of light colors after pretreating with stain remover, and washed in cold water. I let them air dry, and they look and fit like brand new."

I\u2019d also size up too, my feet usually don\u2019t swell too bad and I\u2019m able to fit into the same size as pre pregnancy however when I tried these shoes for a week I noticed my feet throbbing within the 1st hour and by the end of the work day my feet where so swollen that i could cry. I work in the hospital to give more visual."

I wouldn\u2019t use for long distance run or walk but I will happily wear to work walking on a college campus and shorter walks. Super lightweight and offers decent arch support. Just not as supportive as athletic shoe or heavy arch support if that\u2019s what you need"
