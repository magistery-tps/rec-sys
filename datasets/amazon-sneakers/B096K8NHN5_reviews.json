The thing I like the least about this shoe, the shoe is hard to put on, the loophole on the back is to small to put your finger into, to help you pull the shoe o to your foot. These shoes are like socks with a sole.  SMH, if you make the loophole bigger, this shoe would not be to bad."

They replaced them with a much newer-looking pair of shoes, which I was happy to see. They fit okay, but a little bit tight. I appreciate the immediate response to my complaint."

I work in warehouse walking or racing on concrete floor for 8 hours no sitting down no standing in place and this shoe is not acceptable, which was what I bought them for based on someone else's review! the sizing is accurate if you wear thin socks but if you wear heavy socks in winter you need a bigger size although , I wont be buying another pair of these! They are fine for standing around at brawlmart trying to look cute but not for walking or working in a warehouse or hard floor environment. the tongue does not give so you have to put your foot on the floor to force it into the shoe. then it gives when you are walking making a loose fit! the laces do little to prevent this, they appear to be for looks.  I have only worn these on weekends to putz to the grocery store and each time I put them on I dislike them even more, but now of course I think it is too late to ask for a refund. bottom line if you're looking for a shoe that works as hard as you and provides comfort and support on concrete flooring then keep looking.... as I am"

    "message": "These are great quality for the money. Beautiful colors and fit comfortably. I bought 2 pairs- neon green and orange. The only issue I have is that they are almost like thick socks, so when putting them on it can be tricky pulling them up from the back part of the shoe. The loop hole is too tiny to stick my finger in and too small to use it to pull up. Still it\u2019s not a deal breaker because they are really cute. I\u2019m hoping they get easier to pull up as I wear them more. On a side note, I bought my 80 year old dad a pair of white ones mens ones because he liked mine. They were impossible for him to put on because of the same issue, so I had to return his."
