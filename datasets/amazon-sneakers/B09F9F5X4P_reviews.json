Read the reviews which were mostly good so I jumped in head first and was not disappointed. They are so beautiful and the brightest shoe I ever seen. I can go hours on my feet and never feel any type of discomfort and I also workout and run in them and they perform with no failure. I also get a lot of compliments and I\u2019m quick to tell them I got them from Amazon. My son likes them so I found a similar pair in his size and he loves his shoes and wants them in every color so we are currently collecting every color."

These are *amazing* they help provide extra cushioning for my back problems, I've gotten multiple compliments on them at work and have since had several coworkers ask me for the information on them and they've purchased them as well. The only downside is they're not actually slip resistant. I work in an OR at a local hospital. If there is any type of dampness/wet floor/fluids on the floor (which happens often in an operating room for sure!)? I will slip and almost die if I'm not wearing those blue slip covers you see people wearing often on TV. But that's a small price to pay for not having blisters and no longer feeling my age when I put roughly 10-15miles of walking in during my 10hr shift. These shoes are life savers and I'll absolutely be purchasing them again!"

I pay 100 to 200 dollars for my walking shoes.  It was after ordering the shoes that I decided to read the reviews.  After reading most of the negative comments , I felt I had made a mistake and would probably be returning the shoes.  Wrong!!!!!  The shoes arrived in two days of course (that\u2019s Amazon for ya).  I wore them today shopping to test comfort\u2026they passed!  I\u2019m a perfect size 9\u2026they passed.  The plastic sole that some complained about!  If you check out the style of the sole, you will see why it has to be plastic and not rubber.  The material is strong but design makes for comfortable heel to toe steps .  The heel flares enough so that if you don\u2019t have very weak ankles, you don\u2019t have to worry about support.  Moving about today\u2026so far my feet feel very comfortable.  But, I have not given them the big test yet.  I walk at least 2 miles everyday\u2026rain or shine\u202625 to 85 degrees.  I do not expect these shoes to withstand that kind of pressure long term.  But if and when they do wear out I will be replacing them, because they are some sharp looking shoes. I have the black and red.  Allow me to take this opportunity to encourage you to indulge regularly in the most underrated exercise\u2026walking!!!  Take it from an 84 year old female\ud83d\ude00"

Put them on and they were just as comfy and snug like I like. I could still feel the hole though. I decide to try a short walk down the street and I didn't even get a quarter of a mile before the balls of my feet were hurting.

    "message": "Not the most comfortable walking on hard surfaces.  Since Nike discontinue their REAX style of shoe (my favorite shoe of all time), I've been looking for a replacement.  I found this shoe and liked what I read and it looked nice.  My disappointment is except for the thin memory foam pad there isn't any additional padding or cushion that will sustain comfort all day.  I'm a massage therapist and on my feet all day and I need strong support all around the shoe.  Initially when you first step into the shoe it feels great, but then it becomes more of a harder surface feel on the bottom of my feet.  I know it said memory foam (which I hate) but thought this shoe would have extra substantial support underneath the foam.  It did not.  The bottom of the shoe is really cool to look at, but it's a hard plastic like substance with zero give.  I wear a medium width and found this shoe to be a tad wider which wasn't a factor in me liking this shoe or not. The foam padding is removable which is good because I will need to add more padding underneath, and so the wider shoe will hopefully accommodate this.  One thing I thought really odd is there isn't a company logo or name of the shoe company anywhere, and there isn't a shoe size listed on the shoe either.  Who wouldn't want to advertise their product?  Strange."

My point is that any serious training or distance in them will begin to bother your feet but because they look so good if you keep light and short you\u2019ll be a hit.

I give the shoes a year and i'll probably replace them. Still very good product and will definitely purchase again."

    "message": "Size: fits as expected. Style: I'm not terribly fussy, but all of the giant writing on the sneakers, which looks a bit ridiculous online, looks absolutely absurd in real life. And the sneakers make my feet look a bit huge... All that said, I have problems with my feet (plantar fasciitis and being on them consistently, so my feet are hardly ever not sore in some way) so I don't give a much of hoot about style if the shoes are comfortable and the price is right. Comfort: ~~ Soles: The soles of these sneakers are really quite solid; given their open and airy design. I was hoping they'd have a bit more give and spring and impact absorption to them. But they do not have any spring, and very little give. They're also a bit noisy until broken in. They aren't uncomfortable; they just not aren't anything like as cloud-like to walk on as one might suppose. ~~ Insoles: soft, comfortable, supportive. ~~ Sneaker body: Light weight, breathable, comfortable. No nasty sweaty hot feet problem here. ~~ Personal problem: I can't wear sneaker/ankle socks with these sneakers because my right sock will begin to be pulled down under my foot inside the sneaker and I will spend a lot of time stopping to remove the sneaker and pull my sock back up. Solution: wear higher topped socks, or sew pompons onto the heels of all of my sneaker socks, or don't wear socks."

I know people say you have to \"break you shoes in\" but the first week of wearing these made my feet sore on the sides due to the cushion like effect that is added on the insides of the shoe. Once my feet got used to that though I had no issues!"

    "message": "I have a really high arch, so finding shoes that fit and are comfortable has been a fight all my life. I read the reviews on these shoes, I crossed my fingers and hoped that I was in the category that also fit these shoes, but figured I was not. As I usually never was. They arrived on time. They looked as described (love the color!) So I went to try them on. I was so surprised that they actually fit in all the right places and the arch was in the right place and was high enough. There is even little arches behind my toes! The whole shoe is comfort! My feet are not quite used to them yet. But they are getting used to them! I will be buying more in a few more colors!!"
