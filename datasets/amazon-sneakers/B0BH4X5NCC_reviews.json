I can fit a finger in the chasm between the shoe and the back if my foot; it\u2019s sad when a size 10 isn\u2019t a size 10\u2026 3. Does Nike have the monopoly on what a consistent size 10 should measure? It sucks that My size 10 is a perfect 9.5 for Salomon, but at least REI had the decency to advise me (love REI). While it truly is a crapshoot on Amazon as to whether brand x is indeed \u201cBrand x\u201d and whether brand x\u2019s 10 will consistently match other manufacturer\u2019s interpretation of size 10, at least this pair of Reeboks (despite its slightly larger interpretation of size10) FEELS VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR AND WALK AROUND IN!!!  Additionally, its at a good price point\u2026"

They are somewhat narrow, as other reviewers have mentioned, and I got them a half size up from my normal size.  While they look nice and are reasonably comfortable, the quality is just not worth a price tag of over $50.  I recommend getting Walmart's walking shoes for $16 and putting in some arch supports or foam insoles in them."

    "message": "Ok i ordered size 9. I went up a size and had to return because ive always worn the classic gum bottoms and they run narrow but the Harman's run sneaker is what i needed because they are more of a M/Wide they look great but were way too large! Second pair i recived in my normal 8.5 had the supposed Ortholite insole was white not blue and thats what i was expecting to get bk when i reordered but they are not by any means supportive! When you go to the shoe store i have always got the actual comfort insole and this deff. is NOT IT! But over all Rebock has always been my #1 all time favorite and they look great and dont feel great as far as the insole. Id suggest if your more than 130/150lbs and want comfort and support because your wearing for that reason or just on your feet for many hours just go buy at the actual store but if you are a shoe junkkie and just wear here and there and dont care for insoles w/comfort and want to save 20$ then go for it! I cant speak for longevity since i just recived them. Go with you reg. Size in this shoe because it runs wide and you will have plenty room left with these Harman's. If your purchasing the classic gums then depending on the width you need you may want to go up a half size. Hope this helps anyone out there struggling with what size they should buy because i know i shure did and thats why i went with the Harmin's because i need a M/W and they look GREAT! And this Co. Was very swift with my exchange i requested exchange and had them 2days later still have to return the 1st pair come tomm. and im happy as long as they last.. i still have my classic gums from high school and their still kicking and have never fallen apart over many years of daily wear! I added in the pic. The sticker proving they are synthetic not real leather as claimed! I've seen sooo many ppl saying these were real and never took the time to actually look! I am highly upset about that and its where they just snap on the fake orthopedic foot for your. That little blue foot feels more orthopedic than my insole lol... again i hope this helps anyone!"

Now I am one of those people that had plantar fasciitis, Achilles issues, knee problem, and all. Not saying these shoes help with that because you simply have to fix your posture, ie weight management, muscle strengthening, and stretching in order to alleviate those issues, but because I have gone through that process; these shoes are ideal for lots of walking and a busy day when you have corrected your walking form. Very balanced shoe."
