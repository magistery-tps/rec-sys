The memory foam mentioned in the product description is way under rated.  It really wonderful and absorbs so much impact compared to my last pair which were thick soled New Balance.  I'm in the high 200s, so that's significant when talked about cushioning the bottom of the foot.  Saw a few people talked about tight in the toe.  If you just slip them on and lace them up that will definitely be a thing.  I relaced them a bit more to my comfort level and they're just fine.  I think the pre-lacing on these is for the maximum snug fit.  All in all, super impressed with these and thinking of buying another pair or 2 for backup while they're cheap."

Other than how tight the toe box is on my big toe, these shoes seem quite well put together and the insole is super soft & comfy. Still really like how they look too.

    "message": "I order Puma Men's Tazon shoes every winter for my hubby as a gift. He loves these shoes! We always order the Tazon line (different colors and styles of Tazon). After months of searching and trying over 25+ pairs of shoes, he finally found a style that works. We've been buying the Tazon line for 3 years now! The quality of this line is great. He wears them almost daily and they hold up well. The last pair after 9 months of wearing them (daily) the only wear we saw was inside the shoe where the back of his ankle hits. The support of the shoe after about a year of wearing them almost daily obviously isn't as good as before, but he always says they're still comfortable. Shoes for him are hard to find since most are uncomfortable for his feet and don't fit correctly. At one point a few years ago we'd tried over 25+ pairs of sneakers (various stores, brands, styles in the same brands, etc) and he couldn't wear any of them! We'd even tried other Pumas with no luck. It was so frustrating and extremely frustrating for him. You see, we'd been through this with dressier shoes as well, tried on a lot. He wanted to give up. Well I'd seen an add for the Puma Tazons and after about an hour of convincing him I got him to try them on. Typically he can tell if a shoe won't work for him the moment he tries them on or walks in them for less than ten seconds. I'd ordered his size and also half a size up. He put them on, walked around and from the look on his face I could tell they worked for him. I will say that he is always a 9, but for this shoe the 9 1/2 fit better for him, so you might want to try the half size up if your regular size doesn't feel right when you try them on. I love how the Tazon line has a bunch of styles and colors too! I've recommended this shoe to a lot of people and will continue to do. If I had my way I'd order a vast amount of colors and styles, but he isn't someone who likes to wear a bunch of different shoes. I did get two pairs this holiday season and told him he's going to alternate to change it up. Thank you Puma for making a good quality shoe that works well for my hubby."
