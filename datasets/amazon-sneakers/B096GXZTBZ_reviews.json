Then again, seems unlikely someone would bother to make knock offs of $75 shoes. It's only day and and maybe they will break in a bit, but I have the following complaints on fit and function: -They squeak with every step.  Coming from the inside (my cotton socks rubbing on the inside sole/liner. -I am 40 something male and wear a 10 wide in most shoes and purchased that here.  I would consider this shoe only moderately wide.  I could definitely use more room in the toe box.  Where the shoe narrows at the top it pushes against my big toe.  My toe knuckles have enough room to lie flat without being bunched up (which is the most important part for me) but just barely. -I am wearing these as business casual and they fall more on the casual side of that.  That said, I would not want to use them for any athletic activity or for lots of walking.  Lack of support and rubbing would likely result in pain for me. -Sole is flimsy (I prefer stiffer)"
