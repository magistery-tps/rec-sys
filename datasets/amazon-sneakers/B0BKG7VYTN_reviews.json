One day we did the equivalent of like 46 flights of stairs. I did not wear them until I was literally leaving for the airport so I didn\u2019t give myself any time to break them in. Somehow my feet didn\u2019t hurt the entire trip. These shoes are great. They\u2019re also pretty cute. I am not someone who casually spends $100 on shoes but I love these a lot and I\u2019m going to buy more."

That's not a big issue for me but I've only worn these shoes twice and the stitching is coming undone. The first picture I took when I just took the shoes out the box. The second is just after my second wear. The shoes are cute but there isn't much arch support. The leather is also artificial which for this price isn't surprising but if you're looking for a supple leather shoes these aren't a good choice."

I have had rheumatoid arthritis since I was 38 years old and I am now 75. The disease has caused so much damage to my feet that several surgeries were required to help relieve the pain and correct some of the deformities that it caused. As a result, I\u2019m always looking for comfortable shoes that will give me good support and not cause additional discomfort. These Cole Haan sneakers fit the bill perfectly for me! I usually wear a size 8 to 8 1/2, so I ordered size 8. They fit me perfectly without pinching, rubbing or hurting anywhere. I got them in white, but I\u2019m so pleased with them that I plan on ordering more in other colors. Thank you Cole Haan for making such comfortable sneakers that I can wear and still feel stylish in."

I've since checked their website to compare the same sneaker and they are in fact authentic Cole Haan brand. If you look at the bottom of the sneakers, you'll see the Cole Haan name & shoe style Crosscourt imbeded on the bottom of the sole! I'm now confident they're authentic Cole Haan. I was glad to see the sneakers are a true white shade & not off white. They're very lightweight. I haven't worn them outside yet; but I tried them on in the house and they seem to be comfortable. I'm a little skeptical if they're genuine leather, because I own another pair of Cole Haan sneakers that are definitely leather. Overall, the sneakers are nice for casual summer wear!"

For my wife's petite tender fashionista feet, these required zero break in before bringing on vacation calling for a lot of walking, although these aren't explicitly purposeful to be 'walking shoes.'. That's extremely unusual, but the leather's as soft as glove leather--yet it looks to be durable too. Arch support's moderate. No signage--no 'designer' label on upper---it's on the sole. The look---well you can see--it's a clean, classic look that goes great with skirts, as is the fashion now, but looks great with jeans too. Just a great high quality pair of shoes that while they don't have some snob appealing designer label broadcasting 'look at me!'-- to the discerning shoe lover, they exude a subtle quality and class that's 'now'--but is also timeless. The way they feel/wear really make the much more widely seen brands w/ lesser quality keather, blaring their colorful labels on their sides seem cheap. Everybody should try a pair of Cole Haan's at least once."

These are true to size since they are a little larger than I would normally wear, but I decided to keep it anyway because it hasn't hindered me in any way. If I buy another pair, I'll stick with an 8. The shoe itself is very soft, comfortable. I have wide feet and these have enough room for me all around so that it's actually comfortable for me to wear for a long period of time."

All other shoes will do the same unless they\u2019re made with bad stuff plastic (which you don\u2019t want btw)!"

She did have the same issue some others listed in their reviews and that was when the shoes were brand new and she wore with no socks, or very low socks, the upper part of her heal was rubbing and it caused a blister. She wore them for a few days with a sock that covered the area and broke the shoes in and now does not have any discomfort when wearing sockless."

I don't know if it's a knockoff or cheaper version, but it's very thin and bigger than my normal size. There's no cushion. It's nice and white, but that's about it."

I bought them in April and I\u2019ve been taking care of them, today I noticed this and made me think, are these really leather? For the price, I am super sad. Yesterday I would have written an awesome review, today, so sad. Would I recommend them? If someone wants to pay a lot of money for shoes that will start showing aging at one month, sure, but for me, I would have loved a shoe that last me years for what I paid. By the way, at first I bought my original size, then I had to go 1/2 down, so they do run larger."

There was quite a bit of heel rubbing the first week or so, but now they're worn in and I love them. They do not make my feet look even larger than they already are, and they wipe off easily unlike white canvas shoes."
