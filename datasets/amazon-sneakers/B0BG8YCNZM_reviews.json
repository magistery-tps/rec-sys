In a EE or EEE shoe my feet have \"room\" like a athletic fit jean vs a slim/ straight fit.  Given that they are so inexpensive I am going to keep them as an outfit shoe for events with limited walking. PS: I also bought a New Fall '22 Cole Hann white sneaker for 4x the price of these that are already getting returned they look different but they fell and support the same."

So I went ahead and purchased a pair on-line without ever having tried them on. In trying them on the first time, they where slightly tight in the length and width. I have warn them for a few days and they have loosened a bit, but they are still a bet uncomfortable. My foot width is regular to wide (it sort of a tweener between a regular and wide foot). I will be keeping these and overall am happy with them, but just want to warn those of you who have a slightly wider foot that apparently Reebok's run a bit smaller and narrower than a true to size fit so try them on before you buy your first pair. For reference, I seem to have a similar issue with Nike shoes. Also, I cannot wear Saucony as they are too narrow for my foot."

So as they were getting worn, I reordered the exact same thing.  Same size 11 1/2.  When the shoes arrived they were much too small.  I sent them back and got a size 12 which is OK but stilll smaller than my original 11 1/2.  I am writing this because it does not seem that hard for a manufacturer to make sure that the sizing of shoes remains constant.  I assume that the plant that made the shoes changed and they made them shorter to save a dime on materials.  Why can't Rebok just make a cast of a foot that is a certain size and then check production samples to insure that the shoe fits.  This is a quality issue for Rebok that costs them more in returns that they save in shorting the materials. I have included pictures of the size difference between the old shoes and the new ones"

    "message": "Bottom line is this RBK Club Memt show white w/blue trim is sporty and comfy for casual walking and has a slightly snug feel in width that might cause those with wide feet to order one shoe-width wider. The uppers are leather and the soles are flat rubber  with ridges for a non-skid surface.  Haven't tested the non-skid surface under wet conditions but the shoes are stable on waxed floors.  The shoes feel a little smaller than the true size but this might be due to the memory foam insert.  I am a 4E size and when I first put my foot in the shoe, it felt like a 2E fit.  I thought they would be uncomfortable but the more steps I took the more comfortable they felt as the foam relaxed in the shoe.  Oddly, they never feel tight after I start walking.  They only feel snug when I first put them on.  It seems that the shoe was constructed to give some arch support via arch indentation/reinforcement but the indentation provides more arch pressure than arch support.  I read reviews that stated the sole felt like you were walking barefoot on the ground.  It appears that RBK added the memory foam to address this problem.  The foam gives reasonable cushion but it's not anywhere near the cushion of your high-end walking and cross-training shoes.  If you view these shoes like you would the popular boat shoes (think cruise ship walking shoes) then these are as good as or better than any of those shoes.  I think the shoe is a solid 4 star shoe."

However, the bottom lacks padding which makes your foot feel like there is a layer of thick cardboard between it and the ground, but that can easily be remedied by purchasing cushy inserts for the shoes but if you have large feet, that might reduce the amount of space available for your foot to rest in.

Another 1/8 inch of foam would add what, 50 cents to the price?  The fit is good, and they have started to mold themselves to my feet, but after a year I still feel every little pebble through the soles.  Will not buy again for this reason.
