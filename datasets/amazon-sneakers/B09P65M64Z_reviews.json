    "message": "I have worked in retail 8+ years and it wasn\u2019t towards year 6 that I realized how important it was to find a shoe with the right support. At age 28 I started having problems with my right foot and lower back from wearing crappy shoes and working on my feet all day long. Luckily I started seeking help from a chiropractor and started wearing the correct shoes before it became a long term issue.  So anyway, I\u2019m just going to get to the point. I\u2019ve worn a lot of different brands, Clarke\u2019s were my favorite for a couple of years. I started having extreme pain in my right knee at the end of my workdays recently. So I decided to do some research and I found these shoes and they are amazing! No knee pain anymore!!! They are very comfy, provide great support, and the heal absorbs any shock that contributed to the knee pain I was experiencing. I was a little reluctant at first to purchase these when I saw someone\u2019s review that said these slip, because I\u2019m already clumsy as it is. But I assure you that these don\u2019t slip and I walk on not just tile floor, but concrete as well while at work. At home I\u2019m fine walking on hardwood without slipping as well. I felt it necessary to write a review in hopes that it helps anyone who is struggling to find a good pair of work shoes that provides them with support and comfort they need! I absolutely recommend these. One thing I do want to mention is with work shoes and gym shoes I always go a half size up. So normally I\u2019m a 7, so with these I ordered 7 1/2 and they fit comfortably and perfect"

I found these shoes while searching for orthopedic footwear. The cushioned, supportive soles as well as the price lured me in. The reviews were mixed but decided to try them. Also based on reviews, I ordered a half size up to be safe. The shoes arrived quickly. There is good support as well as flexibility in sole. The shoes come with a removable arch support and while it was not heavy duty, it is not overly flimsy either. I tried the shoes on with the provided support and with my own arch orthotic. I chose to wear with my orthotic and there was ample space to do so. The shoes is not difficult to get on yet still felt comfortably snug. I debated about ordering a wide shoe as I have in the past for sufficient toe space but did not in this case. The toe box is tall enough and it does not rub on my toes at all which is huge. Way more comfortable. The shoes have great cushioning! No pain in sole of foot even after 14 hours of continuous wear. The shoes are light with great traction. I highly recommend for anyone with similar issues. Already debating whether I should order another pair!!"

My only concern is the lack of support around the heels. These shoes are slip on and I was scared of breaking/rolling an ankle. Also, my feet are a bit slim so maybe that is why I had so much room for error. I think they are great for the price but will probably invest in other shoes for work when I have the money."

As I\u2019m still dealing with swelling I bought them 1/2 size larger than my normal size. They are perfect!  I do use a shoe horn which makes it easier to slip them on.  Once my swelling goes down I don\u2019t think the shoe horn will be necessary.  They\u2019re very cute and comfortable and I plan to buy more in another color."

I am on me feet all day and moving around alot and needed new shoes to give me better support to relieve ankle pain. For reference I am plus size and do have wide feet and suffer from foot and ankle pain. These have been awesome. The lift in the heel gives good posture. They are super light weight and soft and easy to put on. I have gotten nice compliments from co-works and customers. Everyone at work noticed them the first day I wore them. I really enjoy them alot. When I finially distroy them from wearing them everyday for work, I will purchase another pair."

    "message": "Out of the box: Size 8, white. Delivered quickly and on schedule. Packed nicely. Bright white, true to color. I generally wear a size 8 in tennis shoes/walking shoes. My go to pair most of the time are sketchers. I chose these for work because they were basic white and after reading reviews thought I would give them a try, at the price point I was not sure but figured they could be donated and replaced if I didn't like them. I thought I would need \"break in\" time. Realized shortly that I was wrong, it was not necessary. I am a caregiver by trade so I spend most of my day on my feet and wanted to see how well they worked for a while before writing a review. I am 50 years old and have developed arthritis in my ankles, knees, hips, and back so I needed a shoe that would support, cushion, and lessen overall impact on my joints. I have a moderate instep and have some heel pain from time to time. Purchased these shoes in early January and have been working in them since. These have become my go to shoes of choice for everything. They fit like a glove, good support, very light and breathable, my feet do not sweat inside these shoes and if they do it seems that the material of the shoe wicks away the moisture. I do wear them with Peds no show socks, I don't wear sneaker shoes without socks, just a personal preference, I feel that they could easily be worn without socks if that is your preference, the top material is like a stretchy, breathable knit material. I would compare it to pulling on a heavy knit sock with a sole. Different than any shoe I have ever owned, but in a good way. I was pleasantly surprised by the fit and comfort. They add a slight spring or bounce to my steps and provide great impact support for my joints, even when I am having an arthritis flare up. The insoles are easily removed for cleaning and airing out, it is a memory foam insert and quickly started molding to my personal foot shape. Since they are white,, I was concerned that they would be hard to clean and restore the true white. I found that the shoes are easily cleaned. I removed the insoles before cleaning and cleaned those by hand separately. On the shoes I use a little baking soda with some Dawn dish soap as a paste and scrub them a few minutes, and rinse them. I know that the manufacturer says do not machine wash but after I rinsed them I put them in my top load HE washer (no agitator) and washed them on a delicate cycle in tap cold water. I layed them out to dry, I did not put them in the dryer. As you can see in the photo, they are as white now as they were when they first arrived. They have retained their shape, no shrinking, no loss of shape or stretch, still fit the same. I can truly say that I am in love with these shoes. I choose these shoes for all my outings now, to the grocery store, walking, and everything in between where sneakers are an acceptable wardrobe choice. People stop me to ask about my shoes and they get rave compliments. I will be buying more and highly recommend them. Give them a try if you are looking for a supportive, light, easy option for your feet!"

I walked into the grocery store from the street which has lino tiles and I went FLYING! I wasn't really hurt but I was sliding all over the place! Very dangerous for me. I'm extremely disappointed. Previous review: Got them yesterday. They are very comfortable. I like them overall. However, they in NO WAY are a slip on shoe, which they kind of state. You can not step into them. Especially with socks on. In fact, because they are basically a soft, fabric shoe, I had to wrestle with them a bit to get them on. You have to get your fingers in the back and move them around to get them up un your foot. That part id disappointing. However, once on, whey appear to be comfortable. I will be doing a lot of walking in the next week so I'll see how they really are."

Easy to get on with long shoehorn.  Look just fine.  Support though - I guess an all day wear for me isn't in the cards just yet.  Spent about 4 hours on my feet with about 2 - 20 minute breaks in there and my feet were sore.

My ankle is too small or the shoe fabric is too big for my small ankle. Too me, I was not expecting because the picture image, the tope of the je Kline of the shoe was form fitting to her ankle."

They are pretty cute for slip on shoes. I bought the taupe and i think i can wear them with most things. Im truly impressed."

    "message": "I wanted a sneaker that was comfortable, breathable and slip on since my current laced-sneakers I treat as slip-ons anyway. Maybe I bought a 1/2 size too small but while it is comfortable and does the job, I realize my big toe hurts after a while and I eventually start slowing down and maybe even get to the point of just giving up entirely and resorting to another mode of transportation. I live in NYC so walking is done a ton. The other day I just walked from 48th St & 6th Ave to 14th St & 3rd Ave before deciding I couldn't walk in these anymore and took the bus home. I also used to wear these to stand on my feet for about 7.5 hours when I worked as a doggy daycare receptionist where a lot of being on your feet was done and I would just hate the shoe so much at the end of the day and not wear it again for another week. If you need a pair of shoes for a short while say... a quick errand, sure! But if you're looking for a pair of shoes to stand on all day, this isn't it."

Super lightweight, I\u2019m usually an 8.5 in sneakers, sometimes a 9, I got an 8.5 and they fit perfect. Very comfortable and not slippery to walk on at all. I\u2019ll be getting in white too soon. They really are exactly what I was hoping for at about $40."

They are perfect for me currently because I am just starting to bear weight on my other foot after foot surgery, and most of my flat shoes were to flat and too low compared to the air boot on the other foot .  These ones are the perfect height to allow me to stand and walk straight, with even hips."
