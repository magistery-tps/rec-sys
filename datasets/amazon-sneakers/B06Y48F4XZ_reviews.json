This one does at least fit, though the extra wide a size up is still snug, but that's typical. It's not the most comfortable shoe ever, but it's better than a lot out there. For the price, aka under $50, it's a good shoe. My only complaint is that it is the most slippery shoe I own. I bought them because they seemed reasonably water resistant. I got these shoes to wear on my evening walks when it's rainy out, and I don't want to wear rain boots but don't want mesh shoes. Unfortunately, I slipped three separate times the one time I wore them. I have not slipped wearing any of my other walking shoes. If they made a non-slip version, I would definitely consider buying it, especially in an xx wide."

I've been wearing New Balance walking shoes with the SL2 last for decades, and those have been very good to my feet, but I need a little more zing for my spirit sometimes, so being able to buy a comfortable supportive walking shoe in 10 Wide in colors other than white, black, grey, and taupe thrills me."

They were so good that i decided to try the Romy in black (usually do not buy shoes online) and am so pleased i took a chance with both pairs. They are very comfortable right away and look good.They are made of leather so i don't think they will 'crack' apart. Got them at a good price too."

Overall it's well constructed. very good support and padded ,but this is not a wide.  if it's available get a double wide if you're a normal wide. Because they were a good shoe overall . my friend took them and she's very happy with them. I bought the Skechers wide sport tennis shoe and that was a perfect fit."

I did have to go up half a size.They were comfortable from the moment I put them on, the padded areas around the heel and tongue are wonderful. I took this pair with me to Europe, and they made my feet very comfortable walking around on cobblestone streets. Cobblestones are very uneven an hour to test of a good sneaker.

    "message": "I suppose you can't expect a whole lot for a reduced price I mean you get what you pay for....I'm reluctant in buying shoes because I have a hard time finding a comfortable shoe and I don't believe in paying a lot of money I just wish they were more comfortable now I'm trying to find insoles to fix that. They are loose in the heel. There is extra eyelets to tighten them but that hurts the upper portion of my foot. So I tried to use the extra eyelets again and there's something about how the heel fits or is manufactured because it pulls my socks down which makes it really uncomfortable so everything that I tried to do to make these fit right is not working other than that it's a good shoe"
