Lots of cushion inside. I am getting professional orthotics soon and there is enough room in these (with the stock inserts removed) that they should be fine, and still look good. I like how they don't look too big even though I have large feet. I can wear them with skirts. Very chic! I wear a size 9.5 in most American shoes and a 10.5 fits perfect. If I intended to wear thick socks or stand up for a long time I would get an 11 though."

However, they are super comfortable they\u2019re great for work if you have to walk or be on your feet and they are very stylish. You don\u2019t have to break them in and they keep your toes with a lot of room. What I try to do is at the end of the day stuff the shoe with a big sock so the creases/ flakes don\u2019t get bad. I don\u2019t regret my purchase :p"

(I think the \"SoftFoam\" insert causes the size to fit smaller than usual.) I got the all white color which has a leather upper; I bought them from Amazon as the seller and the ones I got do not look fake and are real leather. The sole is a little thicker & has a little more height than my Stan Smiths. I'm a little worried that the ridges around the sole will get dirty easily, but I treated them with a water repellant spray before wearing & wipe them after each wear to try to keep them clean. Been wearing them for a couple of months, and I would buy these again especially for the price and given that they are leather."
