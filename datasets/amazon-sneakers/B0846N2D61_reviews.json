I almost felt like I was just wearing socks they were so light! I took them for a run and was always surprised that my knees and ankles didn't hurt. Every shoe is different. Some may find these are cushioned enough, others may find that they don't have enough support. But, they are perfect for me. With any shoe, I recommend that you find a pair that feels good on your feet and that don't hurt you. These shoes were great for me."

I did not do a full size up like recommended by them but I probably could get away with an 11.5. Basically do yourself a favor and order atleast a half size to a full size up then what your normally used to. You'll be glad you did. Otherwise, for the price your getting a good value, decent comfort and quality, and they look pretty good too!"

They\u2019re very lightweight and comfortable for a full day of walking, and the wider toe bed gives plenty of room for my foot to spread out. The only downside is the stock insoles - very thin with no significant support, and they slid around inside the shoe. At one point one insole had actually crept up the back of my heel and was poking out the top of the shoe! However a quick $20 investment in some off-the-shelf gel insoles and the problem was solved. I\u2019d buy this model again when these eventually wear out."

This changed last month when I purchased a pair of Brooks and was reminded how my feet and back SHOULD feel when wearing a respectable athletic shoe. My loyalty to NB was justified. As a size 13 X-Wide, they always made my size widely available without breaking the bank. Over the past few years, I've noticed a gradual decline in price along with a considerable decline in quality. In athletic footwear, you generally get what you pay for, and I am saddened that NewBalance has taken the route of quantity over quality. After 6 weeks in my Brooks, my feet feel better and my spinal pain has reduced with footwear being the only change. Beware of anything coming from NB under $100. They are NewBalance in logo only and should not be trusted; your body deserves better."

I have also ended up wearing them to work most days as they are just too comfortable to pass up when I'm grabbing shoes in the morning. **All that said, I do not use these shoes for jogging or hiking. I prefer a shoe with lots of stability when I jog and hike and these have very little of it. I have a fair amount of pronation in my steps and these are not able to account for that. And as far as hiking goes, these shoes not only have no support, but the sole has no traction whatsoever. I would recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe and/or casual everyday shoe. But I would not recommend these shoes for any use with a higher impact than just walking around."
