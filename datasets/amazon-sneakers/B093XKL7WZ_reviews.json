Took a chance to go to the wider soul & at first I felt it was too wide but after releasing the uneven shoe laces and readjusting the lace tension, it gave me the room, widthwise, I needed for my foot that I've never experienced before in all other shoes. I looked at Skechers, Reebok, Nike, Puma etc and none would give me the choice of width!? Thank God New balance isn't a cookie cutter company as everyone has different needs and they produced an awesome pair of shoes for a very reasonable price - I'm SO grateful. The guy that did the above video review is not lying about taking them to Disney world, you could walk forever & you feel like you're on air, it also holds firm your inner ankles where no other shoe has done before. Love them - thank you so much New balance, your my go to shoe now until you get greedy and start becoming uncompetitive and raising the cost where people cannot afford!"

A good fitting well-made shoe is critical to optimum performance levels. New Balance has always been a great shoe, and this one is perfect for my current activity level; mostly walking, light jogging and the gym. Very happy with the fit, comfort level, foot support, quality, and price. Highly recommend!"

My feet are so wide I prefer a 6E, so I can go down to an 11 1/2 for length. these have a lot of padding so this shoe in a 12 with 4E is just fine. they still need to be broken in, but if you\u2019ve had wide feet all your life like me and you know by how they feel on arrival that they will fit, no shoe stretcher needed."

    "message": "I wear an 11D in most all shoes, boots and sneakers. I currently have two New Balance pairs in size 11D. This shoe was marked and sold as an 11D but my big toe was tight to the end.  It may be because the shoe feels like there is too much height/padding in the heal and it pushes your foot forward in the toe.  Regardless, it was a generally weird fit, unlike my other New Balance shoes, so I decided to send it back. They may have given in over time, but I did not want to risk wasting my money on an ill-fitting shoe. Build quality was good! Update 10/23/22:  I did send the 11D back and thought I would try a 12D. The length was maybe a tad more than I needed but worked out in some respects: The 12D was a much better fit than the 11D and I had a bit of room for a thicker sock. There then was a problem that arose in that the metatarsal area on my left foot was giving me trouble that I never had.  I removed the NB, removable insoles that have \"fancy\" raised areas but are not practical for all people. I then bought some new, smooth inserts with a firm foam layer plus a layer of memory foam. These new insoles reveled to me there was a deeper condition beyond the factory insole's raise areas, that were bothering my metatarsal.  It appears to me there is a problem with the basic construction of the sole. It just doesn't seem to be sturdy enough not to transfer either the tread pattern or just some other irregularities in the foot bed construction which put undue pressure on the sole of my foot. To keep trying, I then another dense, flat insole, under the memory foam insoles to hopefully bridge the irregularities of the footbed but to no avail.  The shoe was roomy enough to accommodate the double insoles, but nothing I did seemed to help and the fact that these shoes were just plain uncomfortable and caused a problem with my feet, and mostly the metatarsal area. I can't quite grasp how so many people love this shoe. I have had many middle level NB walkers and cross trainers, and these have been by far the most uncomfortable/painful. Unfortunately, I will relegate these to occasional use and light chores and not for any P.T. and no walking."

    "message": "No matter where you are around the world, if you got wide feet, you like walking comfortably and you your budget is tight....stick to the 608, stock up on as many as you possibly can. I've been importing the NB 608 for years. Here in Egypt shoe stores don't offer wide and extra wide variants in any brand, I tried these years ago and since then I don't feel the need to try any other. All shoes have a short life span if you use them extensively, and my case one pair lasts about a year in good condition until it starts to age poorly and falls apart. To me that's normal for this price range, I just keep buying new ones. The weakest area on this model is the mesh part on the sides near my bunions, the stitching seems to fall apart quick, then the mesh starts tearing. The cutout seems to help with flexibility and comfort, but I hope they either ditch it or use a sturdier type of mesh in future upgrades. I also believe that using a damp cloth to clean it up speeds up the wear of the leather. All in all... I enjoyed v4 and I'm enjoying v5 maybe even more with the flatter midsole. Look for discounts throughout the year and stock up on these babies, they're comfortable, stylish and the extra width is definitely its best feature New Balance offers."

    "message": "Bought these shoes specifically for use during racquetball. This is the second pair that I've bought. It's just super hard to find good athletic shoes for playing racquetball. For the price, they're hard to beat. I play raquetball two days a week, and for 2 hours each day, so I put these shoes through their paces and got about 1.5 years out of them. I'm actually surprised they lasted as long as they did. Their grip on the polished hardwood floor is great and with all the side-side movement I never injured an ankle. Regarding the comfort and sizing. I wear a size 9.5 EEE so it's always nice to find a good shoe with the correct width. These shoes fit that 9.5 EEE perfectly. Not too big or short, and just the right width. It does take about 3-4 weeks of racquetball to break them in, though. Until then they aren't quite as comfortable on the court and my feet are a little sore at the end of the matches. Highly recommend these shoes."

I am a \"wide\" in many shoes and I have both std width (used for gym only) and now wide (for walking) NB shoes. The std is a little snug while the wide were comfortable with no break-in necessary, but the one very minor, vanity driven comment is that wide \"look\" bigger.  There nat be more padding at the ankle, which is good o prevent chafing, and the soul is wider to distribute my weight, which is also good, but because these are a bigger than my other shoes, my eyes exaggerates what my wife's eyes do not see.

Just plain old comfortable shoes! They fit fine. They aren't knock offs. I can't speak to how they are for working out but for just everyday wear, they are great! The last pair I bought I wore daily for 2 years before they started getting uncomfortable and falling apart. Now, if you wear them at work and walk a lot like I do, expect them to wear out faster. My work pairs only last about 9.months but I do a lot more walking at work than off work. And what's wrong with comfortable shoes anyway? Nothing! Darn kids today think all men over 50 wear dad shoes no matter what kind of shoes they wear! Yes, I wear white crew socks with them! Big deal! At least I'm not wearing knee high black socks with them. Well... I do wear black compression socks with the black pair of these shoes I wear to work but that's different! That's for work! Darn kids these days! They need to get offa my lawn!"

    "message": "Great shoe, definitely durable. I have had New Balance before, but not in the last couple of years. I never ordered shoes online until this pair. 608 V5 were a perfect fit. I just looked at my old shoes that were not NB and ordered that size. I generally take days of research and hours in the store to pick a pair that I think will work for me. Not a cheap shoe, not too expensive either, but 100% worth the extra you will pay for 2 pair of cheaps that fall apart in a few weeks or a month. The leather uppers didn't crinkle, like the cheap vinyl ones do. Clean up real nice. The sides take hot concrete well. I walk .9 to and from work every day. This shoe keeps me walking and it doesn't feel like my ankles have been crushed. I work retail so in addition to walking to/from work I'm on concrete all day. Sometimes I'm in the cooler/dairy, sometimes I'm outside bringing carts in. I could be anywhere on any given day and my feet need to keep up. This shoe can absorb the shots. Looks good, feels good. I got the white w/navy N. Will buy white w/black N next. I might not ever trust another shoe to perform like this one has so far."
