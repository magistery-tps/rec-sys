After taking them out of the box and inspecting them I have decided I will only be able to wear them indoors a few hours at a time.  This shoe looks okay but is not practical for walking or everyday use. The width is narrow as pictured which is part of the sleek dress look. Unfortunately the materials used are poor quality and it is assembled badly as well. The insoles have a cheap and poorly cushioned foam and as stated in previous reviews: no arch support. My advice:  Don't be cheap! Go ahead & spend a few extra bucks for a quality dress sneaker. You get what you pay for."

    "message": "This review is for the Steve Madden Men's Fenta Fashion Sneaker - Grey Fabric. These shoes look good, but don't look quite as I expected.  The fabric is a slightly darker grey and the soles are much more of an aged white than depicted.  My pair didn't have any of the defects shown in other reviews. My first complaint is that these shoes are very stiff.  Sure, I haven't broken them in yet, but I have purchased plenty of shoes in my life and none were this rigid.  If this changes after they are broken in, I will update my review.  My second and biggest complaint is that these shoes are very slippery on tile flooring.  They are worse than socks!  Though they do have a normal amount of grip on carpet/sidewalks. Bought these shoes on Cyber Monday.  Looks like I saved $3 off the regular price. Update: After closer inspection, the soles are coated with a fibrous material causing them to be slippery. After about a mile of walking on pavement, enough of this material will wear off to increase the grip to an acceptable level.  Just be cautious about going to the grocery store in a brand new pair of these shoes."

Most shoes work without me needing a wide in my size. However, with these I would definitely need a wide in order to wear for an extended period of time. The heel is of decent width. They area around the balls of my feet and toes was narrow compared to my expectations. I feel that the price is to high given that there isn\u2019t a wide size option. If they were half the price I wouldn\u2019t have any complaints because I would have expected the fitment to be a little off. As far as arch support. There was not hardly any to to mention. But in this style I wasn\u2019t really expecting a ton anyway. The color is nice and pretty much exactly what I expected. But again my main complain is the toe box being to narrow. After the first full day of wearing them my toes were hurting once I took them off."

The toes were so long I couldn't walk in them, and I had to tie the shoelaces so tightly to keep the shoes on that they were uncomfortable to wear.

I haven't done anything but just walk around in them. It's pretty disappointing. If the quality were better, I would absolutely love them."
