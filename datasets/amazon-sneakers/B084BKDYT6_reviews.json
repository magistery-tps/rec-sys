I am happy with my purchase. I bought my size and they fit perfectly. I'm not sure why the other brands seemed to be smaller when I purchased them but these shoes have not changed at all."

The laces were already laced, and there is a knot in the lace that I can\u2019t get out. There is a little bit of debris on the bottom of the shoes. As if they\u2019ve been walked in. I\u2019d really like to know if they are used. Because I\u2019d pay for a \u2018used\u2019 price."
